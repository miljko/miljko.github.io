        <meta name="description" content="This website is: a public repository of articles, lectures, and other original works I authored or co-authored; a place to repost comments, reviews, and recommendations I wrote on other sites (like Quora, Amazon, etc); a place where my half-baked ideas and philosophizings go if I think them interesting enough for general consumption. This last one is what gives me trouble. Ideally, if I think a topic is worth writing about, I should make the extra 3-day effort to gather references, edit it nicely, and have it published. But like the character in “The bridge on the Drina” who means to be the town chronicler but can never find an event worthy enough to write about, most subjects have me less excited the more I think about them. By the time I finish a blog post, then, I have no intention to revisit the matter. This is an excellent filter against appearing foolish in print, but horrible for productivity. Two solutions come to mind readily, with equal chances of failing—either stop posting the third category of articles altogether and start writing everything with an intention of publishing; or start writing even more with the hope that at least a small percentage of that will turn into something a journal would accept for publication. The former is a set-up for procrastination, the latter—doing extra work in a hope to create material for even more work—oxymoronic . I will try both and see where I end up." />
