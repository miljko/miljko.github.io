                <div class="summary"><p>A solid attempt in recreating <a href="https://youtu.be/GB2yiIoEtXw">musical films of old</a> that succeeds in all the technical details ‚Äî the cuts are smoother, the camera livelier, the sets more real ‚Äî but fails in a thing that matters more: <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/26/whiplash/">talent</a>. Literally anyone (<a href="https://youtu.be/jWEXGaupvlQ">yes, anyone</a>) from the cast of Hamilton would have been a better choice for Bigeye‚Äôs partner. Heck, Justin Timberlake would have made more sense, being a human being of actual musical ability, and if you are forcing me to recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/TA0VnUGu62o?t=11s">Curly</a> for a role in your movie, your have miscalculated&nbsp;horribly.</p>

<p>The only way Gosling would possibly have made sense was if you were making a point that anyone could sing, but then don‚Äôt make the character a musician, and better don‚Äôt do that movie at all since <a href="https://youtu.be/wjohhUyfCeY?list=PL2rnwFFQ-ThgnmoVYthu3TNVQ1SCrVEIb">it had already been done much better on <span class="caps">TV</span> 15 years ago</a> by a man who <a href="https://youtu.be/FTMuZSeSwIk">knows his musicals</a>. And this is clearly not what Chazelle was trying to do, what with him incorporating <a href="https://youtu.be/JpCLxnVpgbo">high-level bizarre dance numbers</a> and movie-making subplots reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin'_in_the_Rain">greatest American movie ever made</a>.</p>

<p>Emma Stone is a real jewel,&nbsp;though.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>A faux-continuos shot of a washed-up superhero movie star trying to stage a Broadway comeback. The way it plays with space and time is admirable, and the law company of Keaton, Norton <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Stone does their job with perfection, but the subject matter is so far up Hollywood‚Äôs large intestine that <i>Birdman</i> should best be compared to <a href="https://youtu.be/15JsYSZIT-Q?t=1m3s">another well-known continuous shot</a>.</p>

<p>It is on-your-nose pretentious, and artsy by design, yet too loaded with contemporary references to become timeless. Its one deep message ‚Äî the one about criticism ‚Äî was <a href="https://youtu.be/Ih6jcKd7VwU">much better stated, and with a more positive attitude, a decade ago in an animated film about a rat</a>. I√±√°rritu must have made it on a&nbsp;dare.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>An old-school paint-by-numbers war movie. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3_iPskjxk">Each kind of scene in it has a bar that‚Äôs been set long ago</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5p5j_K0CsY">and it doesn‚Äôt surpass any of them</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxLFdJLSho8">Some are so high above it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt exist</a>. It does set some standards of its own, most notably for dehumanizing the enemy, who is never given more than 10 seconds of film at a time and always with <a href="http://j387mediahistory.weebly.com/anti-japanese-propaganda-in-wwii.html">a growling face straight out of a propaganda poster</a>.</p>

<p>That is a shame. The story of Desmond Doss as told in 2016 deserves better than a <span class="caps">WW2</span> also-ran and <a href="http://people.com/movies/the-true-story-of-hacksaw-ridge-and-desmond-doss-the-medal-of-honor-winner-who-never-fired-a-shot/">an illiterate journal article</a>, for at least two reasons: he saved everyone he saw on the battlefield, American and Japanese; and no-one could get the number of people he helped straight, even as he was being given the Medal of Honor. Wondering how the other side thinks and feels, and sorting between truths, half-truths, and alt-truths are the themes of this decade, so it must have taken a lot of determination (or ignorance) on Braveheart‚Äôs part to ignore them so completely. Sort of like I‚Äôm ignoring Mel‚Äôs pet theme that wants to be central but can‚Äôt quite make&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><span class="caps">PS</span>: Spiderman Jr. does his best doing Jimmy Stuart doing a pious army medic, and almost makes it. Vince Vaughn makes a good drill sergeant. This is not a failure of&nbsp;acting.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Neurotic burglar with a heart of gold meets neurotic gay private investigator for some neurotic fourth wall-breaking shenanigans. Ironman‚Äôs vintage post-rehab quips are supposed to be endearing, but turn the movie into an annoying <i>Ally McBeal</i> spinoff that‚Äôs even less sure of itself. Val Kilmer‚Äôs misshapen botoxed head mumbles through most of the lines, <a href="https://youtu.be/KgSkCewy-LU?t=2m10s">though his penis features in a memorable scene</a>. There are many more gags that are just as good, but are connected by a not well thought-out metaphor (is it a home movie on a reel? on tape? is it just playing in Downey‚Äôs head?) to make a twisty-turney plot that‚Äôs meant not to be followed (not unlike this&nbsp;sentence). </p>

<p>Good thing Michele Monaghan is there to eat their lunch and make the movie&nbsp;watchable.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>A poem in three verses about introversion and grit that is also a story about a boy growing up black and gay and functionally parentless in a poor Florida neighborhood. Through symmetry, silence, and omission, that depressing premise ‚Äî imagine having to be a teenager in Florida ‚Äî never invokes depression. Compare and contrast to <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/">sad tales of straight white lower-middle class woes</a>.</p>

<p>Since issues of identity, gender, and race are somewhat of a thing in this early 21st century, the movie is also a Rorschach test for its audience. A thousand opinion pieces bloomed in its wake, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxAKQoKORI&t=6s">few of which as deep as a single scene</a>, yet quite a bit more pretentious. Thousands more are to come in liberal arts colleges across the country, and deservedly so ‚Äî many films tend to induce sympathy and elation in one particular group of people, awkwardness and shame in another, and this one time those two groups have&nbsp;flipped.</p>

<blockquote>Parker&#8217;s a young kid, pretty good on the sax, gets up to play at a cutting session, and he fucks it up. And Jones nearly decapitates him for it. And he&#8217;s laughed off stage. But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices, and he practices with one goal in mind: Never too be laughed at again. And a year later he goes back to the Reno and he steps up on that stage and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard. So imagine if Jones just said &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay Charlie. That was alright. Good job.&#8221; Then Charlie thinks to himself &#8220;Well, shit. I did do a pretty good job.&#8221; End of story. No Bird. That, to me, is an absolute tragedy. But that&#8217;s just what the world wants now. People wonder why jazz is dying. I&#8217;ll tell you, man - and every Starbucks &#8220;jazz&#8221; album just proves my point, really - there are no two words in the English language more harmful than &#8220;good job‚Äù.</blockquote>

<p>If delivering this dialogue gets you an award, how on Earth does writing it not also get you one? Never mind the precise shots, impeccable pace, <a href="https://youtu.be/-Vb5G8xjc_0">midpoint that could have been a short movie on its own</a>, and the adrenaline-surge-inducing ending that is musical, cinematic, and deeply philosophical all at once.
