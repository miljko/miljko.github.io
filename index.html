                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/12/ending-medical-reversal/">Ending medical&nbsp;reversal</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>The first thing I picked up after taking the hematology boards was this gem from Chicago&#8217;s medical royalty ([Adam Cifu](https://twitter.com/adamcifu)) and everyone&#8217;s favorite oncologist (this is of course a joke — you know that people hate your guts,&nbsp;[Vinay](https://VPplenarysesh)).</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t, and still don&#8217;t, care much for the title. It is ambiguous: if medical reversal means overturning an established practice that was based on weak to no evidence once stronger evidence comes along — usually in the form of a (multi-center, blinded) randomized controlled trial — why on earth would you want to end reversals? Well, the book is about how to stop those kinds of practices from becoming established in the first place, which would indeed end medical reversal, but an easier way to stop them and one that would be endorsed by most of industry and many researches would be to just not look. &#8220;Ending Medical Reversal the Hard Way&#8221; is therefore a more appropriate&nbsp;name.</p>

<p>Title aside, I agreed with pretty much everything they wrote, from reforming medical education, through stopping direct-to-consumer marketing and direct-to-academic (not their words) payments, to having more people participate in (simpler, cheaper, and fairer) randomized trials. I enjoyed their honesty and clear style, and wished my medical school had at least a passing resemblance to the one they proposed (if you thought <span class="caps">US</span> medical education leaned too much on basic science-oriented and was heavy in professorial mechanistic proclamations, try the average European med school). Granted, I work in a federal research hospital and focus on some of the rarest of the rare diseases; but that only makes me shake my head in disbelief more when my colleagues who specialize in breast or lung cancer, not to mention coronary artery disease and diabetes, randomize enormous numbers of patients to search for minute differences in surrogate&nbsp;outcomes.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/10/20/stubborn-attachments/">Stubborn&nbsp;Attachments</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>This is as close to a &#8220;Rules for Life&#8221; book as we&#8217;ll get from Tyler Cowen, and if you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.conversationswithtyler.org">listened to his podcast</a> or <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com">followed his blog</a> what&#8217;s inside won&#8217;t surprise you — but it will make you think. Which is good: surprise is overrated anyway, and things that depend on it don&#8217;t do well on re-reading/watching/listening. I&#8217;ll be coming back to this&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>Cowen argues that growth is good even when it doesn&#8217;t benefit everyone all the time. There are things that can grow that you can&#8217;t measure (like happiness, life satisfaction, health, culture, feeling of superiority [I may be misremembering some of these]), so don&#8217;t focus on wealth only but instead on Wealth Plus. Also, distant future is just as important as the near future, so don&#8217;t sacrifice long-term prospects for short-term gains. Speaking of future, we can&#8217;t predict it, so even though tiny decisions can influence it in an oversized manner we should stop fretting over those and focus on the big picture: which is to chose policies that provide the greater sustained benefit sooner. Finally, common sense morality can usually steer you in the right direction, but if it feels like it&#8217;s not, remember everything else in the book and you should be all&nbsp;set.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, except that I kept imagining someone from Serbia — currently a second-world European kakistocracy — living by the standards of this book. Hilarity ensued: for things would be included in Wealth Plus that Cowen hadn&#8217;t foreseen (the ability to redraw borders, to name one), and common sense morality would include good doses of nepotism, chauvinism, and the desire to cheat the state (yes, yes, I know,&nbsp;#notallserbs).</p>

<p>So the first thing that&#8217;s keeping this book from being great is that it can&#8217;t be universally applied — it was written by an American for his fellow Americans who have lost their way — and doesn&#8217;t explore, or even mention, the implications of his vague concepts of Wealth Plus and common sense morality being different around the&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>The second is that shortly after admitting that economists don&#8217;t have crystal balls (the twelve-year-old me would have loved to put parentheses around &#8220;crystal&#8221;), he goes on to compare hypothetical policies based on their projected rates of growth well into the future. It may be my lack of an economic background speaking, but how can those two go&nbsp;together?</p>

<p>But do read the book. After my first pass I can say it&#8217;s good, if not great. For me as a doctor the idea of delaying gratification for long-term gains felt familiar. The oncologist in me would add that inflicting harm for a known long-term benefit is also reasonable and depending on the alternatives even preferred. Of course, it took centuries of wading in the dark before medicine got to the point where it could with any certainty predict the outcome of its interventions. Are social sciences there&nbsp;yet?</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Znam da je u Srbiji nešto postala vest kada mi u par dana na WhatsApp dođe isto pitanje od tri različite osobe koje međusobno ne komuniciraju. Obično se ispostavi da je neko sa polu-znanjem engleskom i potpunim neznanjem medicine probao da prevede nešto što je neko sa za nijansu većim znanjem oba napisao na osnovu nečijeg saopštenju za&nbsp;štampu.</p>
<p>Zato, malo uputstvo za tumačenje vesti o medicinskim&nbsp;istraživanjima:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ako istraživanje nije na ljudima već na životinjama ili ćelijskim linijama, prestanite da&nbsp;čitate;</li>
<li>Ako je istraživanje na ljudima ali se spominju reči kao “retrospektivno”, “intervju”, ili “ishrana”, prestanite da&nbsp;čitate;</li>
<li>Ako vest o istraživanju dolazi sa konferencije za novinare a ne iz objavljenog rada, prestanite da&nbsp;čitate;</li>
<li>Ako osoba koja piše vest nije potpisana imenom i prezimenom i nema iskustva u pisanju o medicini i nauci, prestanite da&nbsp;čitate;</li>
<li>Ako u vesti nema komentara od lekara ili naučnika iz Srbije koji stavlja nova saznanja u kontekst srpske medicine, prestanite da&nbsp;čitate.</li>
</ul>
<p>(svaka od ovih stavki zavređuje zaseban tekst, prve dve i nekoliko, ali život je&nbsp;kratak)</p>
<p>Bez konkretnih cifara, imam osećaj da je broj tekstova koje vredi čitati u dnevnim novinama i nedeljnicima o lepoti i zdravlju nula, a u malo ozbiljnijim nedeljnim i mesečnim listovima 1-2 godišnje. Što je samo za nijansu manje od broja objavljenih radova koji uopšte zavređuju pažnju&nbsp;laika.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Jane Jacobs loved Greenwich Village so much that she wrote a book about why that was and why more neighborhoods weren’t like it. She looked at other similar areas in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. as well some failed ones, and gave a few guidelines on what was needed for safe, lively, and desirable city&nbsp;streets.</p>

<p>It has enough whimsical observations of city life to keep things interesting for its too-many—over 400—pages (e.g. on a city park’s homeless population: <i>Almost imperceptibly, like the hand of a clock, the raggle-taggle reception creeps around the circular pool at the center of the square. And indeed, it is the hand of a clock, for it is following the sun, staying in the warmth. </i>Or, comparing a safe-but-dirty city street to a desired but decidedly unsafe park: <i>The sidewalks were dirty, they were too narrow for the demands put upon them, and they needed shade from the sun. But here was no scene of arson, mayhem or the flourishing of dangerous weapons. In the playground where the night-time murder had occurred, things were apparently back to normal too. Three small boys were setting fire under a wooden bench. Another was having his head beaten against the concrete. The custodian was absorbed in solemnly and slowly hauling down the American flag</i>). It’s all quite&nbsp;lovely.</p>

<p>But ultimately, it is an exercise in confirmation bias that misses as many essential points as it reveals. What was arguably the most devastating influence on American cities — Robert Moses — is but a misguided elderly official who, and kudos to him, knows his way around public funds. City planners like big, disruptive projects because of their bad (deductive!) reasoning, not because they give politicians photogenic ribbon-cutting&nbsp;ceremonies.</p>

<p>If you want to know why American cities are the way they are, better read <i>The Power Broker</i>.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Extraordinary set pieces strung together by the thinnest of plots, based on an absurd, sitcom-worthy failure to communicate. A particular subplot should have been spun off as a buddy cop&nbsp;movie.</p>

<p>The Ray-Luke-Kylo triangle should have been a bigger part of the movie, but then many of the new characters, the ones that aren’t white and/or men, would have nothing to do. Such are the problems of building on an old and popular franchise: you can’t both stay true to the roots and change with the&nbsp;times.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>The world in general, and the <span class="caps">US</span> in particular, is spending too much on goal-directed, targeted biomedical research while undervaluing both applied and theoretical physics. Picture <a href="http://www.da-vinci-inventions.com/aerial-screw.aspx">Leonardo da Vinci drawing helicopters</a>: that’s the modern-day cancer researcher. The universal cure for cancer — and there should be one, if humanity survives long enough to create it — will not come from an <span class="caps">NIH</span> grant. If grants are involved at all, it will be something initially funded by the National Science Foundation. The current system of funding (government, non-profit, biotech, you name it) is broken, and if you account for the opportunity cost it is a complete disaster. Each of these statements deserves at least a paragraph, but I am saving my carpal tunnels for a manuscript, an <span class="caps">LOI</span>, and a couple of protocols (oh, the&nbsp;irony). </p>
<p>In the meantime, a few things physician-scientists should do for the overall&nbsp;good:</p>
<ul>
<li>find causes and create better prevention strategies, because a look at the <span class="caps">SEER</span> database will tell you that it’s not just bad&nbsp;luck;</li>
<li>eliminate barriers for administration of known curative therapies world-wide (do we really want to leave this to politicians and&nbsp;economists?);</li>
<li>ensure <em>rapid</em> and <em>honest</em> evaluation of the many new treatments, procedures, and diagnostic/prognostic methods coming out of the biomedical&nbsp;behemoth.</li>
</ul>
<p>How beneficial any of this would be for one’s career is a different question altogether, but let’s not get into incentives because <span class="caps">RSI</span>. I am also very open to opposing opinions, since my being wrong would make my life&nbsp;easier.</p>

<p>Observe <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbMnBfiy6iFYce7cJRbZUVPvueGADTt3">the 1960s-1990s televised plays and <span class="caps">TV</span> dramas</a>. I still have vivid memories of watching one particular <em>product</em> the first time it aired, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oic-oTVOc">about a Serbian family keeping in touch with their ex-pat relatives in Germany via <span class="caps">VHS</span> tapes</a>. Replace camcorders with smart phones and speed up the timeline to account for the internet, and it could have been shot today. Technology changes, people&nbsp;don’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HMr6sRAxl1GfI1vtEbznKzfQHEYQo5">My favorite childhood <span class="caps">TV</span> show</a> hasn’t aged well at all; then again has anything from the ‘90s? If you consider most of it was made during a civil war and in a time of hyperinflation it is actually quite good. What was 90210’s excuse? Better kids’ shows have been made in Serbia both <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HMr6sRAxkthNVJMLxJCcPCrndbXPJ_">before</a> and <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbMnBfiy6iH2TZq6DzM2fX485rDJcpdw">after</a>.</p>
<p>Best for last: the celebration of hard core nerddom that is Serbia’s longest-running quiz show, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SlagalicaRTS">important enough to have its own channel</a>. It starts with anagrams and math problems, makes a detour to Mastermind, then finishes off with three different ways to test for trivia. Jokes about the autism spectrum would be writing themselves if this were an American show, but it’s not, and (before I left, at least) Serbian viewers still had some admiration for the participants. It is all very serious and competitive, and has been on the air every weekday for the last 24 years. (A political side-note: this does not mean Serbia is free from anti-intellectualism, quite the opposite in fact. Some combination of militant anti-intellectuals, gas-lighters, and proponents of economic/financial scientism has been in positions of power since the early 90s. There are no lessons here, just&nbsp;observations). </p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/12/24/unpopular-opinions-1/">A few unpopular (in certain circles) opinions from a person who has no rights having&nbsp;them</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>For better or worse, the American system of government is strong. Those who say otherwise have a financial interest in people thinking the&nbsp;opposite.</p>
<p>Culturally, <span class="caps">US</span> has more similarities with Iran than with Saudi Arabia, even if you count religion and religiosity as part of culture. The Christian right is working hard to make them even more&nbsp;similar.</p>
<p>Though still quite hard, it’s easier for a high-skilled immigrant to come to America than to any other country in the world. Comparison is even more favorable for low-skilled and unskilled immigrants. For all of them, quality of life, acceptance, and protection they get are better than anywhere&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>The randomness of the Green Card lottery process is a feature not a&nbsp;bug.</p>
<p>Reading the non-fiction sections of The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and whatever their conservative equivalents are, is good for generating fake insight but ultimately pointless. The Economist is useful for a tiny segment of the population but lets be real: if you’re reading this you are not&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The only useful section in the daily newspapers is Local. Maybe Sports, if you are into that sort of thing, but professional and college sports are a scam so stick with the amateur&nbsp;leagues.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TSA</span> agents and airline personnel are nice people but some passengers check out their brains at the curb and make everyone’s lives less&nbsp;pleasant.</p>
<p>Apple hardware products are underpriced for what you get but do you actually need what they offer? This doesn’t include the AirPods, which are the best thing Apple has made in the last 20 years and still underpriced; though they unfortunately resemble in both name and appearance <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/EarPod">a mind control method from Doctor Who S2</a> and paired with a smart phone are not far from&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The world doesn’t need another <span class="caps">IPA</span>. America needs more&nbsp;tripels.</p>
<p>This is all coming from a non-immigrant resident alien with no expertise in politics, international law, transportation, or technology. I do know beer&nbsp;though.</p>
