                <div class="summary"><p>A biography of the Rockefeller patriarch. It’s a messy book, but then it was also a messy 97 year-long life. A few&nbsp;highlights:</p>

<ul><li> He benefited from starting his business, unencumbered by monetary or ideological debt, just when one of the greatest technological leaps of human history occurred. What got him all that money was luck and ruthlessness more than business acumen (what others thought) and religious zeal/hand of God (what he thought). His subsequent mostly failed business ventures confirm&nbsp;this.</li>
<li> Even so, it is his religion that led him to become the world’s greatest philanthropist, and also set up a template for modern billionaires on how to donate most of their fortune formally and on a grand scale. Yay for religion,&nbsp;then?</li>
<li> Rockefeller’s company /Standard Oil/ and other trusts emerged at a time when legislature couldn’t keep up with rapidly evolving technologies; by the time laws caught up, it didn’t matter. Private data and human attention are 21st century&nbsp;oil. </li>
<li> You also have corrupt politicians, populist presidents, and progressive and gender/racially sensitive (dare I say woke) but ineffective intelligentsia. It all seems very&nbsp;familiar.</li>
<li> A search for “John D Rockefeller” on youtube brings mostly conspiracy videos and hilarious reenactments. I did find [one video of the man himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0DuV1wpDhY) in which he looks eerily like my&nbsp;grandmother.</li></ul>

                <div class="summary"><ol>
<li>Science and the real world: Too many abstracts touted their “real-world” data meaning to say their analysis was retrospective. No shame in a well-done chart review, but calling it “the real world” dilutes the phrase. When the <span class="caps">NCI</span> director referred to real world data in his not-well-enough-attended <span class="caps">ASH</span> speech, it was to describe prospective collection of structured data in routine clinical practice. It can also be used to describe pragmatic clinical trials, with looser eligibility criteria and fewer treatment restrictions. The “real world” abstracts I saw were&nbsp;neither.</li>
<li>Steve Horwitz’s weird weekend: How many oral abstracts can one person have in a single meeting? Apparently, four; three of which were spread over two T-cell lymphoma sessions held on the same day. These were all multi-center trials, one global, so not exactly venues where one may cede the podium to their mentee (some of whom had their own orals to deal with). But&nbsp;sheesh.</li>
<li>T-cell lymphomas have their day (maybe?): The global trial was <span class="caps">ECHELON</span>-2, and it showed an overall survival benefit of first-line brentuximab vedotin + <span class="caps">CHP</span> over <span class="caps">CHOP</span> in <span class="caps">CD30</span>+ T-cell lymphoma. Which is great, only ~80% of patients in the control arm did not get <span class="caps">BV</span> on progression due to the trial being global and <span class="caps">BV</span> not being available in most of the countries. There were several more would-be flies in the ointment, but <span class="caps">US</span> <span class="caps">FDA</span> approved <span class="caps">BV</span> for first-line treatment of <span class="caps">CD30</span>+ <span class="caps">TCL</span> even before the paper was out in The Lancet (which was on the day of the talk). Thus the incredible path of data for <span class="caps">BV</span> in first-line <span class="caps">TCL</span> was: press release -&gt; <span class="caps">FDA</span> approval -&gt; Lancet paper -&gt; <span class="caps">ASH</span> oral. Again,&nbsp;sheesh.</li>
<li>Spotlight so bright: I moderated an oral abstract session, and it was fun, but oh wow did the spotlights hurt my eyes. Much respect for anyone who has to stand in front of them&nbsp;professionally.</li>
<li>Let’s have it in San Diego every year, please, and thank&nbsp;you.</li>

                <div class="summary"><p>An introduction to the normal distribution and to our incompetence in dealing with probability. Since it covers a different type of probability than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness">“Fooled by randomness”</a>, and only skims the heuristics and biases discussed at length in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking%2C_Fast_and_Slow">“Thinking, fast and slow”</a>, it works well as a prologue to both books. This trio should be mandatory reading for premeds, by the way, with the rest of Taleb’s Incerto rounding out an advanced curriculum.  They would for sure have served me better than the anemic statistics textbooks I had to plough through in the early&nbsp;‘00s.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>I’m glad the author, Roger Lowenstein, didn’t even attempt to appear impartial in this, Amazon’s most highly rated of Warren Buffett biographies. It’s the reverse of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker">Power Broker</a> hit job: in the reprint afterword, Lowenstein is wistful about not getting more praise from Buffet while the aforementioned is signing the author’s personal copy at a conference. How wonderful it would be if our heroes loved us as much as we love&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Granted, Buffet is an easy person to love, what with being an aw-shucks Midwestern pro-government regulation democrat who is modest, smart, and also one of the richest people in world. That he first earned his money off of America’s addiction to sugar and shopping, followed by tobacco and war, followed by decidedly inegalitarian buddy deals, all while neglecting his wife to the point of her leaving, and his children to the point of their becoming New Age musicians, just supports his claim to being the most American of all American heroes.&nbsp;Kudos.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/20/a-wrinkle-in-time/">A Wrinkle in Time&nbsp;👎</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>So much wasted potential in this one. It could have been a great movie for both children and adults, a Labyrinth for the age of <span class="caps">CGI</span> and social justice. Instead, it’s a confused, hurried mess in which lots of Stuff happens for no good reason; a Michael Bay extravaganza for your middle-schooler. My daughter (6) liked it, but even she questioned a major plot point. “But, why did X become evil, daddy?” I’ve no idea, Honey, and I’m not sure the screenwriters gave it much thought&nbsp;either.</p>

<p>Such is the faith of many book adaptations; this one even more so, having had to pass through the Disney committee wringer. I haven’t read the book(s? That’s how much I know about the potential franchise) but I’ve read and watched enough fantasy to know that 1) your made-up world needs to have rules, and 2) if you break them, it better be for a good reason. The few week rules set in the Wrinkle’s first half are promptly broken at the half-time, with no explanation and nothing to replace them. Instead you get a holodeck of a planet, where anything can happen: hurricane in a haunted forest turns into a Stepford wives cul-de-sac turns into a crowded beach, and no there is nothing connecting those&nbsp;dots.</p>

<p>Which is too bad — each one of those scenes would’ve made a good episode for the second season of the unmade Wrinkle <span class="caps">TV</span> show, perfect for Disney’s new streaming service. Such a&nbsp;waste.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/15/il-15-flavors/">The three flavors of&nbsp;interleukin-15</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>One thing I realized at <span class="caps">SITC</span> this year was that not many people know (or care?) about the difference between the <span class="caps">IL</span>-15s now being tested in trials. There are: the recombinant human (rh)<span class="caps">IL</span>-15, the <span class="caps">IL</span>-15/<span class="caps">IL</span>-15Ralpha heterodimer (hetIL-15), and <span class="caps">ALT</span>-803, the “super-agonist”. You’re better of <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019">reading a more comprehensive review</a>, but some highlights are&nbsp;below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The simplest, oldest, and seemingly most potent is the plain vanilla&nbsp;rhIL-15.</li>
<li>Four dosing strategies have so far been tested: bolus (too toxic, <a href="http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2014.57.3329">published</a>), subcutaneous (<span class="caps">OK</span>, about as good as <span class="caps">ALT</span>-803 in increasing NKs and <span class="caps">CD8</span>+ T cells, <a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2017/12/02/1078-0432.CCR-17-2451">also published</a>), 10-day continuous infusion (the most potent, but who wants to sit in a hospital for 10 days, should be published soon), and a 5-day infusion (same 40-fold increase in <span class="caps">NK</span> numbers in half the time! <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/miljko/status/1061004684759056385">presented at <span class="caps">SITC</span></a>)</li>
<li>None of the patients in any of the regimens had a <span class="caps">RECIST</span> response, but most mounted an impressive lymphocytosis, leading to several planned combination&nbsp;trials</li>
<li>
<p>It is available for investigator-initiated studies through <span class="caps">CTEP</span>. They will also give a few vials for preclinical&nbsp;studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Novartis owns hetIL-15, and is running the phase I alone and in combination with their anti-<span class="caps">PD</span>-1. Nothing published, but I’ll have more to say about it next&nbsp;year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="caps">ALT</span>-803 is an <span class="caps">IL</span>-15/<span class="caps">IL</span>-15Ralpha heterodimer blessed with a single point mutation which confers upon it both increased binding to the common gamma chain, and validity to the claim of new <span class="caps">IP</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>It is the only one shown to have efficacy as a single agent (<a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/1957">though not in solid tumors</a>), and the only one to be part of a published and/or presented combination (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30148-7/fulltext">with nivolumab in <span class="caps">NSCLC</span></a>, and with rituximab in <span class="caps">FL</span>).</li>
<li>What’s presented so far makes it less potent than rhIL-15 in increasing cell counts, but more convenient to give: via once-weekly subcutaneous injections for an 8-fold increase in&nbsp;NKs.</li>
<li>The company, Altor Biosciences, had been fairly open to IITs — one of them is currently open at <span class="caps">NCI</span>’s <span class="caps">GU</span> Malignancies Branch — but maybe not so much since being acquired in August 2018 by NantCell, a Patrick Soon-Shiong&nbsp;company.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more, of course, but I’ll end instead with another plug for <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019">our review</a> of cytokines in cancer&nbsp;therapy.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/13/car-nk-sitc/">Yes, <span class="caps">CAR</span>-<span class="caps">NK</span> cells are exciting (as exciting as they can get after a phase I single-center yet-to-be-published&nbsp;trial)</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>For more than a year now, the big names of <span class="caps">CAR</span>-T-cell world have been sharing their excitement about the potential of <span class="caps">NK</span> cells to be a much better <span class="caps">CAR</span> carrier. There are many hypotheses about why that would be, but you can hypothesize all you want until you give the product to humans. <span class="caps">PET</span> scans can lie, but not nearly as much as your average transgenic mouse&nbsp;model.</p>
<p>Well, anti-<span class="caps">CD19CAR</span>-NKs have now been given to at least 9 humans, <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelodwyerMD/status/1061357814625591296">as reported by Dr. Katy Rezvani</a> from the <span class="caps">MD</span> Anderson Cancer Center at the <a href="https://www.sitcancer.org/education/annualmeeting"><span class="caps">SITC</span> Annual Meeting</a> a few days ago, and what she reported was as good as it gets for a first-in-human trial of a new gene/cellular therapy. The five&nbsp;takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Off-the-shelf cord blood-derived <span class="caps">NK</span> cells carrying a <span class="caps">CAR</span> can safely be given to humans without <span class="caps">HLA</span>-matching. This could decrease both cost and time to&nbsp;treatment.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/stephaniecornen/status/1061365182373523456">None of the nine patients had cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity.</a> After all, <span class="caps">NK</span> cells aren’t big cytokine&nbsp;producers.</li>
<li>Six of nine patients had a complete response and one more had a partial response for a 77% response&nbsp;rate.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/DrMiguelPerales/status/1061414200969494529">One of those CRs and one <span class="caps">PR</span> were patients with <span class="caps">CLL</span> and Richter’s transformation</a>, another <span class="caps">CR</span> was in a 70-year-old with double-hit lymphoma, and yet another in a patient with <span class="caps">CLL</span> and 17p deletion. These are tough&nbsp;diseases.</li>
<li>Contrary to what was hypothesized about <span class="caps">NK</span> cell longevity, the <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs persisted for up to six months after treatment. We still don’t know what that means for <span class="caps">CAR</span>-Ts, let alone <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs, but I consider it a win each time experiment refutes&nbsp;theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yes, I am also excited about <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs.&nbsp;However:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is an unpublished, non-peer-reviewed, single-center experience. There could be research hospitals out there giving <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs with results too horrible, or just too middle-of-the-road, for early&nbsp;promotion.</li>
<li><span class="caps">CLL</span> is notoriously difficult to stage, and five of the nine patients had <span class="caps">CLL</span>. Consider <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1713976">the <span class="caps">MURANO</span> trial</a> (Venetclax-Rituximab combo fo relapsed/refractory <span class="caps">CLL</span>), in which the investigator-assessed complete response rate of 26.8% turned to 8.2% on independent review committee&nbsp;assessment.</li>
<li>Follow-up is limited and it is too early to know the response duration. Long enough to get to an allo transplant, at&nbsp;least?</li>
<li>The same limitations in target availability we have in <span class="caps">CAR</span>-T cells apply to <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs. It has to be a surface antigen with limited to no expression on normal cells. There aren’t too many of those, particularly in solid&nbsp;tumors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, kudos to Drs. Rezvani, Shpall, and others at <span class="caps">MD</span> Anderson. This is as good as it gets at this early&nbsp;stage. </p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/12/ending-medical-reversal/">Ending medical&nbsp;reversal</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>The first thing I picked up after taking the hematology boards was this gem from Chicago&#8217;s medical royalty (<a href="https://twitter.com/adamcifu">Adam Cifu</a>) and everyone&#8217;s favorite oncologist (this is of course a joke — you know that people hate your guts, <a href="https://VPplenarysesh">Vinay</a>).</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t, and still don&#8217;t, care much for the title. It is ambiguous: if medical reversal means overturning an established practice that was based on weak to no evidence once stronger evidence comes along — usually in the form of a (multi-center, blinded) randomized controlled trial — why on earth would you want to end reversals? Well, the book is about how to stop those kinds of practices from becoming established in the first place, which would indeed end medical reversal, but an easier way to stop them and one that would be endorsed by most of industry and many researches would be to just not look. &#8220;Ending Medical Reversal the Hard Way&#8221; is therefore a more appropriate&nbsp;name.</p>

<p>Title aside, I agreed with pretty much everything they wrote, from reforming medical education, through stopping direct-to-consumer marketing and direct-to-academic (not their words) payments, to having more people participate in (simpler, cheaper, and fairer) randomized trials. I enjoyed their honesty and clear style, and wished my medical school had at least a passing resemblance to the one they proposed (if you thought <span class="caps">US</span> medical education leaned too much on basic science-oriented and was heavy in professorial mechanistic proclamations, try the average European med school). Granted, I work in a federal research hospital and focus on some of the rarest of the rare diseases; but that only makes me shake my head in disbelief more when my colleagues who specialize in breast or lung cancer, not to mention coronary artery disease and diabetes, randomize enormous numbers of patients to search for minute differences in surrogate&nbsp;outcomes.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/10/20/stubborn-attachments/">Stubborn&nbsp;Attachments</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>This is as close to a &#8220;Rules for Life&#8221; book as we&#8217;ll get from Tyler Cowen, and if you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.conversationswithtyler.org">listened to his podcast</a> or <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com">followed his blog</a> what&#8217;s inside won&#8217;t surprise you — but it will make you think. Which is good: surprise is overrated anyway, and things that depend on it don&#8217;t do well on re-reading/watching/listening. I&#8217;ll be coming back to this&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>Cowen argues that growth is good even when it doesn&#8217;t benefit everyone all the time. There are things that can grow that you can&#8217;t measure (like happiness, life satisfaction, health, culture, feeling of superiority [I may be misremembering some of these]), so don&#8217;t focus on wealth only but instead on Wealth Plus. Also, distant future is just as important as the near future, so don&#8217;t sacrifice long-term prospects for short-term gains. Speaking of future, we can&#8217;t predict it, so even though tiny decisions can influence it in an oversized manner we should stop fretting over those and focus on the big picture: which is to chose policies that provide the greater sustained benefit sooner. Finally, common sense morality can usually steer you in the right direction, but if it feels like it&#8217;s not, remember everything else in the book and you should be all&nbsp;set.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, except that I kept imagining someone from Serbia — currently a second-world European kakistocracy — living by the standards of this book. Hilarity ensued: for things would be included in Wealth Plus that Cowen hadn&#8217;t foreseen (the ability to redraw borders, to name one), and common sense morality would include good doses of nepotism, chauvinism, and the desire to cheat the state (yes, yes, I know,&nbsp;#notallserbs).</p>

<p>So the first thing that&#8217;s keeping this book from being great is that it can&#8217;t be universally applied — it was written by an American for his fellow Americans who have lost their way — and doesn&#8217;t explore, or even mention, the implications of his vague concepts of Wealth Plus and common sense morality being different around the&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>The second is that shortly after admitting that economists don&#8217;t have crystal balls (the twelve-year-old me would have loved to put parentheses around &#8220;crystal&#8221;), he goes on to compare hypothetical policies based on their projected rates of growth well into the future. It may be my lack of an economic background speaking, but how can those two go&nbsp;together?</p>

<p>But do read the book. After my first pass I can say it&#8217;s good, if not great. For me as a doctor the idea of delaying gratification for long-term gains felt familiar. The oncologist in me would add that inflicting harm for a known long-term benefit is also reasonable and depending on the alternatives even preferred. Of course, it took centuries of wading in the dark before medicine got to the point where it could with any certainty predict the outcome of its interventions. Are social sciences there&nbsp;yet?</p>
