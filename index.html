                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2019/01/25/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind/">Sapiens: A Brief History of&nbsp;Humankind</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>A speedy overview of the past 70 some millennia of humanity. Self-aware without being modest about its proclamations. Very 2014 in its optimism to dread ratio, but with enough forewarning that things might slip at any moment that it doesn’t appear naïve when being read in 2019. A few&nbsp;observations:</p>

<p><br>
<p><ul><li>The book’s main thesis is that civilization as we know it lies on many, many figments of our collective imagination: states, laws, human rights, religions, corporations, etc. The last hundred years have sped this up, pulling people  apart from families and other tangible local communities and into fictive constructs such as nations, sports teams, organized religion, and other forms of fandom. Are Twitter and Facebook communities more or less real than these, and if more, are they why people have been having a hard time suspending their&nbsp;disbelief?</p>
<p></li><li>Many religions are poked, proded, and pulled apart by witty turns of phrase, but Harari turns dead serious whenever buddhism is discussed. Unlike christianity and islam, buddhism gets whole running paragraphs of in-depth explanation. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/2/28/14745596/yuval-harari-sapiens-interview-meditation-ezra-klein">Did the book need a religious disclaimer</a>?</p>
<p></li><li>His go-to example for discussing nationalist myths is Serbia. It figures. Kudos for doing it&nbsp;respectfully.</p>
<p></li><li>Another thesis is that capitalism lives by using up future resources in form of credit, which in turn produces and enlarges those very same future (now present) resources. In addition to being a very <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2397535/">Predestination</a> way of seeing things, does that support or conflict with Tyler Cowen’s thesis in <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/10/20/stubborn-attachments/">Stubborn Attachments</a> that we tend to — but shouldn’t — discount the future? Maybe we (or capitalists, at least) are at the same time optimists by thinking the future will be better by default, but also saying to hell with it by using those perceived future benefits now, to the detriment of future people? To this non-economist modern capitalism looks like an underbaked&nbsp;ideology.</p>
<p></li><li>This is the best-looking and best-made soft cover edition of a non-fiction book I’ve ever&nbsp;read. </p>
</li></ul></p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2019/01/20/handling-email/">How I handle email (which is not how everyone should, but you may find some of these&nbsp;useful)</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>This is all about work email. I have succeeded in transferring most personal communication to Slack, iMessage, and WhatsApp, with a sprinkling of Skype for the grandparents. The sole holdout is Dad, who insists on emailing me links to Serbian tabloid news, child rearing advice, and&nbsp;recipes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">Inbox Zero</a> is a great idea in its original form: live you life and write your emails in a way that solicits as few return emails to you as possible. It means giving some thought to what you put in your responses, and being clear and definitive about them. It doesn’t mean mindlessly deleting or archiving everything or, even worse, sending out half-baked replies just to pass on the baton when you’ll get a dozen of them in&nbsp;return.</p>
<p>I only check email twice a week day and once on a weekend, and with the explicit intent to clean out the inbox (unless when on service or when I’m the primary attending for a sick inpatient). Never check email “just to see what’s there” unless you have the time and the means to do something about whatever you’ll find. More than once in the past I was left to sour over an unexpected administrative roadblock or a non-urgent patient care calamity during a family event, when I could have just as easily waited for Monday&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p>When scheduling meetings: <a href="https://doodle.com/">Doodle</a> (or your preferred equivalent) for more than three people, email is fine for 1 or 2. If using email and I’m scheduling, proposed times, location, and a tentative agenda are all in the initial email. If I’m responding to a meeting request I try to put all of those in my reply, but that also depends on who’s&nbsp;requesting.</p>
<p>I thank in advance, not after the fact, and rarely send emails whose sole purpose is to give&nbsp;thanks.</p>
<p>If I get an unsolicited and unexpected email from someone I don’t know but that’s not obviously a mass posting, I wait for the second one. Most times it never&nbsp;arrives.</p>
<p>If the email looks like it came from a template it gets deleted without being&nbsp;read.</p>
<p>If I am cc’d on an email chain with many recipients and not directly called out, I archive and wait it out. The only exception is when I know that one or two replies from me would be able to end the game of email chicken that these chains tend to&nbsp;become.</p>
<p>The few times that I didn’t follow these guidelines, I came to regret it (<a href="https://fs.blog/2017/05/confirmation-bias/">confirmation bias</a> warning!). I’m sure plenty of people don’t give it a second thought and go by just fine. But they probably don’t work in health&nbsp;care.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2019/01/12/flashpoint-trieste/">Flashpoint:&nbsp;Trieste</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>A history of the Trieste kerfuffle between Tito and the Allies immediately following <span class="caps">WW2</span>, but also an overview of the many warring sides: Non-soviet Allies, the Soviets, Tito’s partisans (“Yugoslavs” but also sometimes “Slovenians” and “Croats”), Chetniks (“Serbs”), Ustashe (“Croats”), Italian communists, Italian fascists, Italian non-communist non-fascist partisans, and let’s not forget the Nazis. Whew… At least the French are out of the&nbsp;picture.</p>

<p>It’s biased towards the Americans and the British, but then that’s not surprising considering the author. All other sides being equally horrible — according to the book at least, and it’s a lazy though intellectually safe stance to make — it manages to be sort of objective but then in a lot of cases resorts to citing some not very objective secondary sources written in the background of a much bigger kerfuffle in the 1990s. Jennings is no Ron Chernow, and even less of a Robert Caro. The region needs someone of Cs’ tenacity and attention to detail to untangle even the footnotes of Balkan history like Trieste. I can’t imagine who would be able to tackle a Power Broker-like biography of Tito, but I’d be happy to read&nbsp;one.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>A biography of the Rockefeller patriarch. It’s a messy book, but then it was also a messy 97 year-long life. A few&nbsp;highlights:</p>

<ul><li> He benefited from starting his business, unencumbered by monetary or ideological debt, just when one of the greatest technological leaps of human history occurred. What got him all that money was luck and ruthlessness more than business acumen (what others thought) and religious zeal/hand of God (what he thought). His subsequent mostly failed business ventures confirm&nbsp;this.</li>
<li> Even so, it is his religion that led him to become the world’s greatest philanthropist, and also set up a template for modern billionaires on how to donate most of their fortune formally and on a grand scale. Yay for religion,&nbsp;then?</li>
<li> Rockefeller’s company <i>Standard Oil</i> and other trusts emerged at a time when legislature couldn’t keep up with rapidly evolving technologies; by the time laws caught up, it didn’t matter. Private data and human attention are 21st century&nbsp;oil. </li>
<li> You also have corrupt politicians, populist presidents, and progressive and gender/racially sensitive (dare I say woke) but ineffective intelligentsia. It all seems very&nbsp;familiar.</li>
<li> A search for “John D Rockefeller” on youtube brings mostly conspiracy videos and hilarious reenactments. I did find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0DuV1wpDhY">one video of the man himself</a> in which he looks eerily like my&nbsp;grandmother.</li></ul>

                <div class="summary"><ol>
<li>Science and the real world: Too many abstracts touted their “real-world” data meaning to say their analysis was retrospective. No shame in a well-done chart review, but calling it “the real world” dilutes the phrase. When the <span class="caps">NCI</span> director referred to real world data in his not-well-enough-attended <span class="caps">ASH</span> speech, it was to describe prospective collection of structured data in routine clinical practice. It can also be used to describe pragmatic clinical trials, with looser eligibility criteria and fewer treatment restrictions. The “real world” abstracts I saw were&nbsp;neither.</li>
<li>Steve Horwitz’s weird weekend: How many oral abstracts can one person have in a single meeting? Apparently, four; three of which were spread over two T-cell lymphoma sessions held on the same day. These were all multi-center trials, one global, so not exactly venues where one may cede the podium to their mentee (some of whom had their own orals to deal with). But&nbsp;sheesh.</li>
<li>T-cell lymphomas have their day (maybe?): The global trial was <span class="caps">ECHELON</span>-2, and it showed an overall survival benefit of first-line brentuximab vedotin + <span class="caps">CHP</span> over <span class="caps">CHOP</span> in <span class="caps">CD30</span>+ T-cell lymphoma. Which is great, only ~80% of patients in the control arm did not get <span class="caps">BV</span> on progression due to the trial being global and <span class="caps">BV</span> not being available in most of the countries. There were several more would-be flies in the ointment, but <span class="caps">US</span> <span class="caps">FDA</span> approved <span class="caps">BV</span> for first-line treatment of <span class="caps">CD30</span>+ <span class="caps">TCL</span> even before the paper was out in The Lancet (which was on the day of the talk). Thus the incredible path of data for <span class="caps">BV</span> in first-line <span class="caps">TCL</span> was: press release -&gt; <span class="caps">FDA</span> approval -&gt; Lancet paper -&gt; <span class="caps">ASH</span> oral. Again,&nbsp;sheesh.</li>
<li>Spotlight so bright: I moderated an oral abstract session, and it was fun, but oh wow did the spotlights hurt my eyes. Much respect for anyone who has to stand in front of them&nbsp;professionally.</li>
<li>Let’s have it in San Diego every year, please, and thank&nbsp;you.</li>

                <div class="summary"><p>An introduction to the normal distribution and to our incompetence in dealing with probability. Since it covers a different type of probability than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness">“Fooled by randomness”</a>, and only skims the heuristics and biases discussed at length in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking%2C_Fast_and_Slow">“Thinking, fast and slow”</a>, it works well as a prologue to both books. This trio should be mandatory reading for premeds, by the way, with the rest of Taleb’s Incerto rounding out an advanced curriculum.

                <div class="summary"><p>I’m glad the author, Roger Lowenstein, didn’t even attempt to appear impartial in this, Amazon’s most highly rated of Warren Buffett biographies. It’s the reverse of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker">Power Broker</a> hit job: in the reprint afterword, Lowenstein is wistful about not getting more praise from Buffet while the aforementioned is signing the author’s personal copy at a conference. How wonderful it would be if our heroes loved us as much as we love&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Granted, Buffet is an easy person to love, what with being an aw-shucks Midwestern pro-government regulation democrat who is modest, smart, and also one of the richest people in world. That he first earned his money off of America’s addiction to sugar and shopping, followed by tobacco and war, followed by decidedly inegalitarian buddy deals, all while neglecting his wife to the point of her leaving, and his children to the point of their becoming New Age musicians, just supports his claim to being the most American of all American heroes.&nbsp;Kudos.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/20/a-wrinkle-in-time/">A Wrinkle in Time&nbsp;👎</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>So much wasted potential in this one. It could have been a great movie for both children and adults, a Labyrinth for the age of <span class="caps">CGI</span> and social justice. Instead, it’s a confused, hurried mess in which lots of Stuff happens for no good reason; a Michael Bay extravaganza for your middle-schooler. My daughter (6) liked it, but even she questioned a major plot point. “But, why did X become evil, daddy?” I’ve no idea, Honey, and I’m not sure the screenwriters gave it much thought&nbsp;either.</p>

<p>Such is the faith of many book adaptations; this one even more so, having had to pass through the Disney committee wringer. I haven’t read the book(s? That’s how much I know about the potential franchise) but I’ve read and watched enough fantasy to know that 1) your made-up world needs to have rules, and 2) if you break them, it better be for a good reason. The few week rules set in the Wrinkle’s first half are promptly broken at the half-time, with no explanation and nothing to replace them. Instead you get a holodeck of a planet, where anything can happen: hurricane in a haunted forest turns into a Stepford wives cul-de-sac turns into a crowded beach, and no there is nothing connecting those&nbsp;dots.</p>

<p>Which is too bad — each one of those scenes would’ve made a good episode for the second season of the unmade Wrinkle <span class="caps">TV</span> show, perfect for Disney’s new streaming service. Such a&nbsp;waste.</p>

You’re better of <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019">reading a more comprehensive review</a>, but some highlights are&nbsp;below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The simplest, oldest, and seemingly most potent is the plain vanilla&nbsp;rhIL-15.</li>
<li>Four dosing strategies have so far been tested: bolus (too toxic, <a href="http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2014.57.3329">published</a>), subcutaneous (<span class="caps">OK</span>, about as good as <span class="caps">ALT</span>-803 in increasing NKs and <span class="caps">CD8</span>+ T cells, <a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2017/12/02/1078-0432.CCR-17-2451">also published</a>), 10-day continuous infusion (the most potent, but who wants to sit in a hospital for 10 days, should be published soon), and a 5-day infusion (same 40-fold increase in <span class="caps">NK</span> numbers in half the time! <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/miljko/status/1061004684759056385">presented at <span class="caps">SITC</span></a>)</li>
<li>None of the patients in any of the regimens had a <span class="caps">RECIST</span> response, but most mounted an impressive lymphocytosis, leading to several planned combination&nbsp;trials</li>
<li>
<p>It is available for investigator-initiated studies through <span class="caps">CTEP</span>. They will also give a few vials for preclinical&nbsp;studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Novartis owns hetIL-15, and is running the phase I alone and in combination with their anti-<span class="caps">PD</span>-1. Nothing published, but I’ll have more to say about it next&nbsp;year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="caps">ALT</span>-803 is an <span class="caps">IL</span>-15/<span class="caps">IL</span>-15Ralpha heterodimer blessed with a single point mutation which confers upon it both increased binding to the common gamma chain, and validity to the claim of new <span class="caps">IP</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>It is the only one shown to have efficacy as a single agent (<a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/1957">though not in solid tumors</a>), and the only one to be part of a published and/or presented combination (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30148-7/fulltext">with nivolumab in <span class="caps">NSCLC</span></a>, and with rituximab in <span class="caps">FL</span>).</li>
<li>What’s presented so far makes it less potent than rhIL-15 in increasing cell counts, but more convenient to give: via once-weekly subcutaneous injections for an 8-fold increase in&nbsp;NKs.</li>
<li>The company, Altor Biosciences, had been fairly open to IITs — one of them is currently open at <span class="caps">NCI</span>’s <span class="caps">GU</span> Malignancies Branch — but maybe not so much since being acquired in August 2018 by NantCell, a Patrick Soon-Shiong&nbsp;company.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more, of course, but I’ll end instead with another plug for <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019">our review</a> of cytokines in cancer&nbsp;therapy.</p>
