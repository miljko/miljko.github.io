		<ul>
<li><em>I don't feel comfortable doing that.</em>—I don't know what you're asking me to do (nurse to intern); I'm too lazy to do it (intern to resident); I think it's a stupid idea and there's no way you can make me do it (resident to attending); You're not paying me enough to do this crap (attending to administration).</li>
<li><em>It's a light elective</em>—You don't need to show up.</li>
<li><em>Needs to read more.</em> (on a written evaluation)—I have no idea how much medicine this person knows. I barely know any myself.</li>
<li><em>The family is reasonable.</em>—Family members don't ask too many questions and will agree with anything you say.</li>
<li><em>The patient has xyz</em>.—I've read in an old discharge summary that the patient has <em>xyz</em>, but have no idea how they established the diagnosis, what stage it is in, or what the hell <em>xyz</em> even is.</li>
<li><em>The head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation. Sclearae are nonicteric.</em>—If I were to report the physical exam I actually did it would take five nanoseconds, so take these fillers to make it seem like I've put in some effort.</li>
<li><em>Thank you for the thorough presentation.</em>—Why did you waste my time with all that useless information?</li>
<li><em>That's an outpatient work-up.</em>—Administration is already breathing down my neck because of this patient's length of stay and you're worried about a mild anemia and a positive hemoccult!?</li>
<li><em>That's her new baseline.</em>—Her disease is worse and we don't know why, so I guess she's stuck with it.</li>
<li><em>Please let me know if you have any more questions.</em>—This is the end of our conversation, so please stop talking. I shall now leave.</li>
