Which is good: surprise is overrated anyway, and things that depend on it don&amp;#8217;t do well on re-reading/watching/listening. I&amp;#8217;ll be coming back to this&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cowen argues that growth is good even when it doesn&amp;#8217;t benefit everyone all the time. There are things that can grow that you can&amp;#8217;t measure (like happiness, life satisfaction, health, culture, feeling of superiority [I may be misremembering some of these]), so don&amp;#8217;t focus on wealth only but instead on Wealth Plus. Also, distant future is just as important as the near future, so don&amp;#8217;t sacrifice long-term prospects for short-term gains. Speaking of future, we can&amp;#8217;t predict it, so even though tiny decisions can influence it in an oversized manner we should stop fretting over those and focus on the big picture: which is to chose policies that provide the greater sustained benefit sooner. Finally, common sense morality can usually steer you in the right direction, but if it feels like it&amp;#8217;s not, remember everything else in the book and you should be all&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all well and good, except that I kept imagining someone from Serbia — currently a second-world European kakistocracy — living by the standards of this book. Hilarity ensued: for things would be included in Wealth Plus that Cowen hadn&amp;#8217;t foreseen (the ability to redraw borders, to name one), and common sense morality would include good doses of nepotism, chauvinism, and the desire to cheat the state (yes, yes, I know,&amp;nbsp;#notallserbs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing that&amp;#8217;s keeping this book from being great is that it can&amp;#8217;t be universally applied — it was written by an American for his fellow Americans who have lost their way — and doesn&amp;#8217;t explore, or even mention, the implications of his vague concepts of Wealth Plus and common sense morality being different around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is that shortly after admitting that economists don&amp;#8217;t have crystal balls (the twelve-year-old me would have loved to put parentheses around &amp;#8220;crystal&amp;#8221;), he goes on to compare hypothetical policies based on their projected rates of growth well into the future. It may be my lack of an economic background speaking, but how can those two go&amp;nbsp;together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do read the book. After my first pass I can say it&amp;#8217;s good, if not great. For me as a doctor the idea of delaying gratification for long-term gains felt familiar. The oncologist in me would add that inflicting harm for a known long-term benefit is also reasonable and depending on the alternatives even preferred. Of course, it took centuries of wading in the dark before medicine got to the point where it could with any certainty predict the outcome of its interventions. Are social sciences there&amp;nbsp;yet?&lt;/p&gt;

It is short, smart, punchy, and very, very meta. It also makes me want to learn Italian, though I understand William Weaver is a good&amp;nbsp;translator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by &lt;/i&gt;Italo Calvino, &lt;i&gt;1981&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Apr 2018 18:02:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2018-04-15:/eng/2018/04/15/if-on-a-winters-night-a-traveler/</guid></item><item><title>The death and life of great American cities</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2018/01/24/the-death-and-life-of-great-american-cities/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Jane Jacobs loved Greenwich Village so much that she wrote a book about why that was and why more neighborhoods weren’t like it. She looked at other similar areas in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. as well some failed ones, and gave a few guidelines on what was needed for safe, lively, and desirable city&amp;nbsp;streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has enough whimsical observations of city life to keep things interesting for its too-many—over 400—pages (e.g. on a city park’s homeless population: &lt;i&gt;Almost imperceptibly, like the hand of a clock, the raggle-taggle reception creeps around the circular pool at the center of the square. And indeed, it is the hand of a clock, for it is following the sun, staying in the warmth. &lt;/i&gt;Or, comparing a safe-but-dirty city street to a desired but decidedly unsafe park: &lt;i&gt;The sidewalks were dirty, they were too narrow for the demands put upon them, and they needed shade from the sun. But here was no scene of arson, mayhem or the flourishing of dangerous weapons. In the playground where the night-time murder had occurred, things were apparently back to normal too. Three small boys were setting fire under a wooden bench. Another was having his head beaten against the concrete. The custodian was absorbed in solemnly and slowly hauling down the American flag&lt;/i&gt;). It’s all quite&amp;nbsp;lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, it is an exercise in confirmation bias that misses as many essential points as it reveals. What was arguably the most devastating influence on American cities — Robert Moses — is but a misguided elderly official who, and kudos to him, knows his way around public funds. City planners like big, disruptive projects because of their bad (deductive!) reasoning, not because they give politicians photogenic ribbon-cutting&amp;nbsp;ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know why American cities are the way they are, better read &lt;i&gt;The Power Broker&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by &lt;/i&gt;Jane Jacobs, &lt;i&gt;1961&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2018 18:30:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2018-01-24:/eng/2018/01/24/the-death-and-life-of-great-american-cities/</guid></item><item><title>The Last Jedi 👊</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2018/01/08/the-last-jedi/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Extraordinary set pieces strung together by the thinnest of plots, based on an absurd, sitcom-worthy failure to communicate. A particular subplot should have been spun off as a buddy cop&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ray-Luke-Kylo triangle should have been a bigger part of the movie, but then many of the new characters, the ones that aren’t white and/or men, would have nothing to do. Such are the problems of building on an old and popular franchise: you can’t both stay true to the roots and change with the&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has cute animals and looks good in 3D though, so Dora (5.4)&amp;nbsp;approves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Rian Johnson, &lt;i&gt;2017&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 10:16:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2018-01-08:/eng/2018/01/08/the-last-jedi/</guid></item><item><title>The hero with a thousand faces</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/06/07/the-hero-with-a-thousand-faces/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;What you do is you take as many fairy-tales and myths and other stories as you can — Campbell is extraordinarily good at collecting them — then squint and trace out the patterns. Us humans are very good at finding patterns where none exist (&lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a17529/a-short-history-of-martian-canals-and-mars-fever/"&gt;just ask Percival Lowell&lt;/a&gt;), so it is no wonder that we end up with an overarching story, albeit disjointed, which is — of course it is — steeped in New Age &lt;a href="https://meaningness.com/monism"&gt;monism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot twist: unlike &lt;a href="http://digitalesammlungen.uni-weimar.de/viewer/image/PPN64011217X/1/#topDocAnchor"&gt;similar attempts in other arts&lt;/a&gt;, this one becomes wildly successful, serving as a template for other stories that end up following it more closely than any of the tales of old ever did (see &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers"&gt;Kevin Garvey’s literal and metaphorical travails&lt;/a&gt; for the most recent example). I like The Leftovers, so I would say The Hero… is a net benefit for the civilization. It just wasn’t for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I stopped reading the book near the end of the first (of two) sections, the one about The Hero’s Journey. I therefore never got to the Cosmogonic cycle, and cannot comment. Do let me know if there was a surprise&amp;nbsp;ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by &lt;/i&gt;Joseph Campbell, &lt;i&gt;2008&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 03:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-06-07:/eng/2017/06/07/the-hero-with-a-thousand-faces/</guid></item><item><title>50/50 👍</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/05/06/5050/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;An oncologist(?), a psychologist, and a surgeon give master classes on unprofessional behavior while treating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JGL&lt;/span&gt; and his &lt;a href="http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/19/2/193.full"&gt;unfortunately named tumor&lt;/a&gt;. Even though only one of the three was meant to look bad in the movie, they each break a fundamental rule of the doctor-patient relationship: don’t be a douchebag, don’t sleep with the patient, don’t tell them everything will be fine when you have no clue. Cut out the profanities, and you’d have a semester’s worth of medical ethics&amp;nbsp;discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut out the profanities, though, and you’ll miss half the movie. Seth Rogen — a dirty old man trapped inside Fozzy the Bear — does what he’s been doing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5iaHTkpTv0"&gt;ever since Judd Apatow found him&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FNskZ6GQz2A"&gt;heart of gold included&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, 50/50 has better timing than anything to come out from the Apatow cringe factory, and even has a&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical miscellanea: was the diagnosing physician a medical oncologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, or an orthopedic surgeon? Likely not the first, else he wouldn’t give neoadjuvant cytarabine for a sarcoma, and probably not the latter two since another, overoptimistic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt; does the actual surgery. Can a psychologist perform interviews for what she admits will be her PhD thesis without getting informed consent? How can a surgeon say with any certainty that “everything will be fine” minutes after performing what she admitted to be a difficult operation &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301698002235"&gt;for a tumor with a relapse rate north of 50%&lt;/a&gt;. You know, the 50% that gave the movie its&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, thumbs&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to be deliberately inoffensive to a particular class of &lt;i&gt;consumer&lt;/i&gt;, it dodges &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v2exWrsGOc"&gt;Mickeydom’s most glorious moments of cultural sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; only to fall on the sword of blandness. But credit where it is due — it takes talent to make a trippy 60s comic book that’s oddly relevant in &lt;a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/03/14/maintaining-sanity-weird-timeline/"&gt;today’s world of magic mystery turmoil&lt;/a&gt; into a boring, predictable, dull, uninspired, yawn-inducing, delta wave-producing, paint-by-numbers origin&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you thought only the Strange-ness was fumbled you must not be a doctor, because &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bUi8Youavz8"&gt;his day job features the most laughable medicine this side of the Human Centipede&lt;/a&gt;. Though I shouldn’t complain too much — I imagine aerospace engineers cringe an order of magnitude more when watching any other Marvel&amp;nbsp;miracle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thumbs&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;

It is on the nose and at times painful to watch, but I would not expect anything else &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADJE5gat_W8"&gt;from the master of the afterschool special&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portman is a pro: she gets you to swallow the banal white swan/black swan analogy whole, and ask for more, goes through every exercise in Aronofsky’s mental torture playbook like it’s nothing, and looks believably cool and composed until she believably isn’t. Watching her in this movie makes a certain trilogy an even bigger crime against&amp;nbsp;directing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thumbs&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

Literally anyone (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jWEXGaupvlQ"&gt;yes, anyone&lt;/a&gt;) from the cast of Hamilton would have been a better choice for Bigeye’s partner. Heck, Justin Timberlake would have made more sense, being a human being of actual musical ability, and if you are forcing me to recommend &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TA0VnUGu62o?t=11s"&gt;Curly&lt;/a&gt; for a role in your movie, your have miscalculated&amp;nbsp;horribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way Gosling would possibly have made sense was if you were making a point that anyone could sing, but then don’t make the character a musician, and better don’t do that movie at all since &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wjohhUyfCeY?list=PL2rnwFFQ-ThgnmoVYthu3TNVQ1SCrVEIb"&gt;it had already been done much better on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; 15 years ago&lt;/a&gt; by a man who &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FTMuZSeSwIk"&gt;knows his musicals&lt;/a&gt;. And this is clearly not what Chazelle was trying to do, what with him incorporating &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JpCLxnVpgbo"&gt;high-level bizarre dance numbers&lt;/a&gt; and movie-making subplots reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin'_in_the_Rain"&gt;greatest American movie ever made&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma Stone is a real jewel,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

The way it plays with space and time is admirable, and the law company of Keaton, Norton &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Stone does their job with perfection, but the subject matter is so far up Hollywood’s large intestine that &lt;i&gt;Birdman&lt;/i&gt; should best be compared to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/15JsYSZIT-Q?t=1m3s"&gt;another well-known continuous shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is on-your-nose pretentious, and artsy by design, yet too loaded with contemporary references to become timeless. Its one deep message — the one about criticism — was &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ih6jcKd7VwU"&gt;much better stated, and with a more positive attitude, a decade ago in an animated film about a rat&lt;/a&gt;.

It does set some standards of its own, most notably for dehumanizing the enemy, who is never given more than 10 seconds of film at a time and always with &lt;a href="http://j387mediahistory.weebly.com/anti-japanese-propaganda-in-wwii.html"&gt;a growling face straight out of a propaganda poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a shame. The story of Desmond Doss as told in 2016 deserves better than a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WW2&lt;/span&gt; also-ran and &lt;a href="http://people.com/movies/the-true-story-of-hacksaw-ridge-and-desmond-doss-the-medal-of-honor-winner-who-never-fired-a-shot/"&gt;an illiterate journal article&lt;/a&gt;, for at least two reasons: he saved everyone he saw on the battlefield, American and Japanese; and no-one could get the number of people he helped straight, even as he was being given the Medal of Honor. Wondering how the other side thinks and feels, and sorting between truths, half-truths, and alt-truths are the themes of this decade, so it must have taken a lot of determination (or ignorance) on Braveheart’s part to ignore them so completely. Sort of like I’m ignoring Mel’s pet theme that wants to be central but can’t quite make&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;: Spiderman Jr. does his best doing Jimmy Stuart doing a pious army medic, and almost makes it. Vince Vaughn makes a good drill sergeant. This is not a failure of&amp;nbsp;acting.&lt;/p&gt;

Ironman’s vintage post-rehab quips are supposed to be endearing, but turn the movie into an annoying &lt;i&gt;Ally McBeal&lt;/i&gt; spinoff that’s even less sure of itself. Val Kilmer’s misshapen botoxed head mumbles through most of the lines, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KgSkCewy-LU?t=2m10s"&gt;though his penis features in a memorable scene&lt;/a&gt;. There are many more gags that are just as good, but are connected by a not well thought-out metaphor (is it a home movie on a reel? on tape? is it just playing in Downey’s head?) to make a twisty-turney plot that’s meant not to be followed (not unlike this&amp;nbsp;sentence). &lt;/p&gt;

Through symmetry, silence, and omission, that depressing premise — imagine having to be a teenager in Florida — never invokes depression. Compare and contrast to &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/"&gt;sad tales of straight white lower-middle class woes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since issues of identity, gender, and race are somewhat of a thing in this early 21st century, the movie is also a Rorschach test for its audience. A thousand opinion pieces bloomed in its wake, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxAKQoKORI&amp;t=6s"&gt;few of which as deep as a single scene&lt;/a&gt;, yet quite a bit more pretentious. Thousands more are to come in liberal arts colleges across the country, and deservedly so — many films tend to induce sympathy and elation in one particular group of people, awkwardness and shame in another, and this one time those two groups have&amp;nbsp;flipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Parker&amp;#8217;s a young kid, pretty good on the sax, gets up to play at a cutting session, and he fucks it up. And Jones nearly decapitates him for it. And he&amp;#8217;s laughed off stage. But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices, and he practices with one goal in mind: Never too be laughed at again. And a year later he goes back to the Reno and he steps up on that stage and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard. So imagine if Jones just said &amp;#8220;Well, that&amp;#8217;s okay Charlie. That was alright. Good job.&amp;#8221; Then Charlie thinks to himself &amp;#8220;Well, shit. I did do a pretty good job.&amp;#8221; End of story. No Bird. That, to me, is an absolute tragedy. But that&amp;#8217;s just what the world wants now. People wonder why jazz is dying. I&amp;#8217;ll tell you, man - and every Starbucks &amp;#8220;jazz&amp;#8221; album just proves my point, really - there are no two words in the English language more harmful than &amp;#8220;good job”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If delivering this dialogue gets you an award, how on Earth does writing it not also get you one? Never mind the precise shots, impeccable pace, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/-Vb5G8xjc_0"&gt;midpoint that could have been a short movie on its own&lt;/a&gt;, and the adrenaline-surge-inducing ending that is musical, cinematic, and deeply philosophical all at once. Movies at their&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;

Since novelty may be the only thing that counts in what is bracketed as SciFi — &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/movie/interstellar"&gt;look at &lt;i&gt;Interstellar&lt;/i&gt; being undeservedly panned&lt;/a&gt; — a movie whose emotional range begins and ends with a side plot of a dying child now has a shot at the Academy Award. Also, and it feels wrong to even have to write this, there are other ways to elicit emotion in your audience than killing off children, &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/"&gt;dear movie-makers of 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect where it is due: passing of Hawkeye as a plausible physicist — by having him not talk about physics the entire movie, but still — and floating the idea of world unification in anno domini 2017 are admirable feats. Not enough to offset the hours wasted on walking through a hallway and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzFnckanHQKM9BV3L8Msbx03OzdIu_78"&gt;80s-style montages&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Denis Villeneuve, &lt;i&gt;2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2017 08:13:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-02-25:/eng/2017/02/25/arrival/</guid></item><item><title>Manchester by the Sea</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A dour movie about dour people living dour lives in a dour New England town. The camera is static and so are our hero’s faces. Long periods of voyeuristic shots of everyday life are punctuated by rare expressions of minimal emotion. Answers to all our questions are quickly revealed and dramatic tension never builds&amp;nbsp;up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of direction is fine if you are &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vGvDCmuDKKE"&gt;talking about a man’s mid-life crisis&lt;/a&gt;, but disturbing when your movie involves three children burning to death. Is seeing a couple of good acting performances worth subjecting yourself to emotional trauma that doesn’t result in a meaningful message (and anything on stoicism of the Irish can hardly count &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JATICtPYGGI"&gt;if the Simpsons have already done it&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical things of note: &lt;i&gt;congestive heart failure&lt;/i&gt; is a diagnosis as broad as &lt;i&gt;lower back pain&lt;/i&gt; (i.e. not a real diagnosis at all); would anyone not work it up further, never mind that it is in an otherwise healthy 40-something; and do they not have ICDs in Manchester, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/779blnz0JU8"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; should not have died, least of all because without his death we wouldn’t have had this&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Kenneth Lonergan, &lt;i&gt;2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 06:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-02-23:/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/</guid></item><item><title>Looper</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/19/looper/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Although a movie that involves traveling through time, Looper is hardly a time-travel movie. Bruce Willis says as much when he brushes off any attempts to discuss the mechanics, implications, paradoxes, etc. for reasons of expediency. So, &lt;a href="https://www.xkcd.com/657/"&gt;Primer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/204"&gt;Predestination&lt;/a&gt;, or even Back to the Future &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; this ain’t. Groundhog Day is more like it, only with shotguns, telekinesis, and a far messier&amp;nbsp;ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s unfortunate for me, since I prefer pure time-travel movies; and there isn’t enough — or any, really — Bill Murray in Looper to justify comparing it to that other category. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JGL&lt;/span&gt; spends too much time pretending to be Willis, who in turn phones it in. Elevator/hallway action scenes are good, but don’t come close to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBwvIX7Sao"&gt;the peak of the genre&lt;/a&gt; (or even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cSUsBzE-Wuo"&gt;the western take&lt;/a&gt;, which was fundamentally a feature-length interpretation of that one scene from&amp;nbsp;Oldboy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, in fact, nothing new to see here, and the movie feels as flat as the Kansas plain it is set in. The one interesting thing about it is that, in what is the complete opposite of &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/21/brick/"&gt;the director’s previous movie&lt;/a&gt;, Looper might be better appreciated in a&amp;nbsp;vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Rian Johnson, &lt;i&gt;2012&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2017 15:53:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-02-19:/eng/2017/02/19/looper/</guid></item><item><title>The Dark Forest</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/15/the-dark-forest/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Starts several years after &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/18/the-three-body-problem/"&gt;The Three Body Problem&lt;/a&gt; and ends 200 years later, shortly after the first (brief, horrific) physical contact with alien technology. The future’s clean, white, Apple-y aesthetic was annoying enough for me not to feel too badly after it imploded, and the humans of the future were just as grating, but I assume that was one of the big points Liu wanted to make (that we are more closely related temporally than we are geographically or genetically, that is, not that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ydkvO6C9pTs"&gt;Jony Ive is a future-human&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point: a book about humanity’s impending demise has a good quarter of it dedicated to one man’s delusions about art and love. Those passages end up being directly relevant to the plot, but if anything, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OVCxJ1aT24A"&gt;that takes away from them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the character who ends up being the book’s main proponent of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poverty_of_Historicism"&gt;historicism&lt;/a&gt; dies in the best standoff &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4GAQtGtd_0"&gt;since the Gotham prisoners’ dilemma&lt;/a&gt;, which ends up being only the second-best of the many standoffs the book presents. It is a beautiful, self-referential standoff&amp;nbsp;heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s one of Tim Burton’s better Tim Burton&amp;nbsp;movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, the plot has holes, and some of the characters’ motivations are… peculiar (har har). The more important thing is this: after seeing it, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/V_fOn_aWCNk"&gt;Dora wanted to fly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out, the generation gap is only a setup for the real fight — that of &lt;a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/09/01/the-origin-of-authenticity-in-the-breakdown-of-the-illusion-of-the-real/"&gt;authentic versus fake&lt;/a&gt;.  It culminates with (old, authentic) Ben Stiller neurotically rollerblading into Lincoln Center, hoping for a catharsis after he reveals to his documentary film-making giant of a father-in-law that (young, fake) Kylo Ren based parts of his own documentary on&amp;nbsp;alt-facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Things change”, replies &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0499002/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t21"&gt;Mr. Breitbart&lt;/a&gt;, minutes after giving a speech on honesty in filmmaking. “Different things matter&amp;nbsp;now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sadly prescient moment in a sadly prescient&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, mom kills herself while hospitalized for depression far away in New Mexico, a road trip ensues, thoughts, feelings, and inadequacies of their lifestyle are exposed. The setup is better than the second act, during which 1) the captain of the freshly single-parent household is predictably un-fantastic, and 2) the middle-crassness of his extended family is blown out of all proportion. The payoff is better — if nothing else, it will make its &lt;a href="https://silverbirchpress.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/pick-up-lines-new-yorker-cartoon-by-frank-modell/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;-reading audience&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Matt Ross, &lt;i&gt;2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 07:26:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-01-29:/eng/2017/01/29/captain-fantastic/</guid></item><item><title>How to write a thesis</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/28/how-to-write-a-thesis/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Umberto Eco’s rules and advice on how Italian university students of modest means should choose a relevant topic, conduct and organize research with limited resources, and format their final undergraduate thesis. Though created by and for someone in the humanities, much of it applies to all sciences — and the parts that don’t are at least&amp;nbsp;entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was written in 1977, revised in 1985, and revised again when translated to English for both cultural and temporal/technological adjustments. &lt;a href="http://diplomski-rad-kako-napisati.blogspot.rs"&gt;A translation to Serbian (which is, amazingly, freely available online)&lt;/a&gt; needed neither, as &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/family-fiefdoms-blamed-for-tainting-italian-universities-2089120.html"&gt;Serbia and Italy have similarly dysfunctional systems of higher education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a book whose most important section is the one on taking notes and organizing research, this edition has remarkably small margins and tight binding. No matter — it will feature prominently in the Acknowledgments section of my PhD thesis, if and when I finish&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by &lt;/i&gt;Umberto Eco, &lt;i&gt;1977&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 17:33:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-01-28:/eng/2017/01/28/how-to-write-a-thesis/</guid></item><item><title>They Came Together</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/26/they-came-together/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The difference between loving homage and gross parody can be subtle, and what the movie ends up being usually depends on whether the author(s) actually like the genre they are spoofing. It is an easy guess, for example, that Edgar Wright likes &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVsL9tUJLHs"&gt;zombie apocalypses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH-CvYpoSUo"&gt;buddy cop movies&lt;/a&gt;, or that Joss Whedon is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufF5p8VBsVk&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqo7ZL09v0c2VLxvak-8uUaR"&gt;into horror films&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who made this thing must truly hate romantic comedies. It doesn’t wink at &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy"&gt;rom-com tropes&lt;/a&gt; — it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqb85Gfj0Fw&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqpFIO718l2rS3eypRgtgLPh"&gt;blows them out of all proportion&lt;/a&gt;, the acting is even cheesier, camera work blander. I could pick out clips for these, but its’s the entire movie. Moreover, the comedies it references are dated, going with &lt;i&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/i&gt; (1989), &lt;i&gt;You’ve Got Mail &lt;/i&gt;(1998), and &lt;i&gt;Notting Hill&lt;/i&gt; (1999) over the more recent and even more ridiculous &lt;i&gt;Love Actually&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K45RdE2qlk"&gt;interconnected plot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_dt27_0vL4"&gt;wannabes&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd-MpXCMcIs"&gt;the jokes are just too obvious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making fun of something &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Every+Romantic+Comedy+Ever"&gt;that is easy to make fun of&lt;/a&gt; is easy. Making a good movie that is also a parody is hard. &lt;i&gt;They Came Together&lt;/i&gt; (ha ha) is a decent&amp;nbsp;parody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;David Wain, &lt;i&gt;2014&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jan 2017 06:35:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-01-26:/eng/2017/01/26/they-came-together/</guid></item><item><title>The Autopsy of Jane Doe</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/23/the-autopsy-of-jane-doe/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A haunted house movie where the house has a morgue in the basement (&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-real-csi-americas-patchwork-system-of-death-investigation"&gt;America is weird&lt;/a&gt;) and the ghost is lying on a stainless steel cart, all peaceful and symmetrical until a father-son team of coroners begins slicing into her. Roose Bolton is again to blame, in a way, but has more sense at the end of this one while leaving room for a sequel (The Autopsy 2: Richmond Horror, a working title that I just made up, so you can stop googling&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice—if short—ride that would be much scarier for those who never attended an autopsy, but between the pacing, the acting, and the near-absence of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8znuHwF490"&gt;jump scares&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the best horror movie I’ve seen since &lt;i&gt;It follows&lt;/i&gt;. It gets extra points for being truer to the genre—&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ietK_lZyDNY"&gt;no hipster soundtracks here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, you can’t put a think chunk of freshly brain under a microscope and see cells, much less figure out if a neuron is alive just by looking at it for 1.5 seconds. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9dw9BweRQk"&gt;Brian Cox can sell anything&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;i&gt;film noir&lt;/i&gt;, complete with a Gordian knot of a plot, gritty textures half-concealed in darkness, and telegraphed archetypes (the loner, the vamp, the &lt;i&gt;femme fatale&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teenagers seem parentless—save for a comic relief scene or two featuring the mom of our archetypal kingpin serving the boys cookies and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OJ&lt;/span&gt;—and the few other adults in the world treat them as equals. Clearly a fantasy, but you will have suspended your disbelief long before&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It fares well when compared to the competition—but then, most of it had been made in the 1940s, so I wouldn’t call it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDyFh0x_ygM"&gt;a fair fight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

It is the 1960s—why waste money on tuition if her only reason for attending university is to find a good&amp;nbsp;husband?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She likes his opera-champaign-trips-to-Paris lifestyle, he likes that she speaks French and looks at him like a God, so it looks like a win-win-win as she abandons high school for an engagement ring. But if you hang around scammers you will get scammed, and soon she learns he has a wife, a son, and countless past &lt;i&gt;jeunes femmes&lt;/i&gt; like her, some of whom ended up with child. A &lt;i&gt;deus ex machina&lt;/i&gt; in the form of an English teacher does help her get into Oxford, and she lives long and well enough to be able to write &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Education-Lynn-Barber/dp/1934633852/"&gt;the memoire that Nick Hornby turned into this screenplay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a masterpiece, but serviceable as educational material for preteens. I hope Dora will grow up not to be as impressionable to&amp;nbsp;sleazeballs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Lone Scherfig, &lt;i&gt;2009&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2017 11:38:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-01-19:/eng/2017/01/19/an-education/</guid></item><item><title>The Three Body Problem</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/18/the-three-body-problem/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Written by an engineer, and reads like it. It uses a broad brush—with not much description or characterization—to explore such trivialities as life, reality, human perception, and humanity’s place in the&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of it has a sense of odd turning into familiar: the bloodshed of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution"&gt;the Chinese Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt; projected onto the book’s pro-alien human factions and real world’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement"&gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement"&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter"&gt;alike&lt;/a&gt; movements; virtual realities inside a nesting doll of x-dimensional spaces &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZgBcRhGPqs"&gt;that may themselves be virtual&lt;/a&gt;; environmental dangers, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity"&gt;imagined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing_final.pdf"&gt;Einstein supposedly pictured himself chasing a beam of light&lt;/a&gt; before developing his theories of relativity. Liu imagined standing on the surface of a planet quite unlike Earth to come to this book and its two siblings. Based on the first installment, I can tell that investing some time in the trilogy will be worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by &lt;/i&gt;Cixin Liu, &lt;i&gt;2012&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jan 2017 15:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-01-18:/eng/2017/01/18/the-three-body-problem/</guid></item><item><title>Children of Men</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/18/children-of-men/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Children of Men&lt;/i&gt; has aged well. Too well. Between Brexit, Zika, islamist fundamentalists, and police brutality, 2017 is much closer to the version of 2027 the movie portrays than what Cuaron could possibly have imagined while writing and directing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brilliant long tracking shots include &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfBSncUspBk"&gt;Juliane Moore’s bloody demise in a post-apocalyptic British mini-car&lt;/a&gt;, and Clive Owen’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twcKoAQ7HIg"&gt;race through a desolate seaside town-slash-rebellious refugee camp&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBzWTIexszQ"&gt;find the only baby alive on Earth&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the movie could now be described as &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sneakysnackhobo/v/115812094"&gt;a Twitch video&lt;/a&gt;, though back then first-person shooters were &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE46AFOqrC8"&gt;decidedly less realistic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this were Interstellar, Owen would have lived through the end and be reunited with a resurrected Moore. Fortunately, it is&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
