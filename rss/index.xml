&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/plenarysession"&gt;Plenary Session&lt;/a&gt;. Many friends and coworkers are amazed that anyone would voluntarily subject themself to Vinay Prasad‘s tirades, but his podcast is well-behaved and a pleasure to listen. The monologues are better than the interviews, which is to be expected: he’s been monologuing his whole life and interviewing for less than a year. And yes, some of his guests/collaborators need too much coaxing, but sock puppets only reinforce the national meeting atmosphere that the name&amp;nbsp;evokes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.conversationswithtyler.com/"&gt;Conversations with Tyler&lt;/a&gt;. Still great. You can start at the beginning, or with &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+PbpIQwDV4"&gt;the one with Daniel Kahneman&lt;/a&gt;, but start somewhere. Most are excellent and all are good, even the ones you wouldn’t guess from the interviewee’s name and&amp;nbsp;bio. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/"&gt;The Knowledge Project&lt;/a&gt;. Farnham Street/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;F.S.&lt;/span&gt; has gotten &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/11/business/intelligence-expert-wall-street.html"&gt;some good press&lt;/a&gt;, and for good reason. It’s self-improvement for people allergic to the self-improvement&amp;nbsp;label. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/"&gt;Revisionist History&lt;/a&gt;. Yet to listen to the latest season, but I can’t see it going badly. Malcolm Gladwell is a&amp;nbsp;pro.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://glasscannonpodcast.com/"&gt;The Glass Canon Podcast&lt;/a&gt;. In the absence of a regular gaming night (never schedule a campaign around three doctors’ schedules), I listen to other people playing tabletop RPGs. No better entertainment, I&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Science and the real world: Too many abstracts touted their “real-world” data meaning to say their analysis was retrospective. No shame in a well-done chart review, but calling it “the real world” dilutes the phrase. When the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCI&lt;/span&gt; director referred to real world data in his not-well-enough-attended &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASH&lt;/span&gt; speech, it was to describe prospective collection of structured data in routine clinical practice. It can also be used to describe pragmatic clinical trials, with looser eligibility criteria and fewer treatment restrictions. The “real world” abstracts I saw were&amp;nbsp;neither.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steve Horwitz’s weird weekend: How many oral abstracts can one person have in a single meeting? Apparently, four; three of which were spread over two T-cell lymphoma sessions held on the same day. These were all multi-center trials, one global, so not exactly venues where one may cede the podium to their mentee (some of whom had their own orals to deal with). But&amp;nbsp;sheesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T-cell lymphomas have their day (maybe?): The global trial was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECHELON&lt;/span&gt;-2, and it showed an overall survival benefit of first-line brentuximab vedotin + &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHP&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHOP&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD30&lt;/span&gt;+ T-cell lymphoma. Which is great, only ~80% of patients in the control arm did not get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BV&lt;/span&gt; on progression due to the trial being global and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BV&lt;/span&gt; not being available in most of the countries. There were several more would-be flies in the ointment, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDA&lt;/span&gt; approved &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BV&lt;/span&gt; for first-line treatment of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD30&lt;/span&gt;+ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCL&lt;/span&gt; even before the paper was out in The Lancet (which was on the day of the talk). Thus the incredible path of data for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BV&lt;/span&gt; in first-line &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCL&lt;/span&gt; was: press release -&amp;gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDA&lt;/span&gt; approval -&amp;gt; Lancet paper -&amp;gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASH&lt;/span&gt; oral. Again,&amp;nbsp;sheesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotlight so bright: I moderated an oral abstract session, and it was fun, but oh wow did the spotlights hurt my eyes. Much respect for anyone who has to stand in front of them&amp;nbsp;professionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s have it in San Diego every year, please, and thank&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;

Since it covers a different type of probability than &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness"&gt;“Fooled by randomness”&lt;/a&gt;, and only skims the heuristics and biases discussed at length in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking%2C_Fast_and_Slow"&gt;“Thinking, fast and slow”&lt;/a&gt;, it works well as a prologue to both books. This trio should be mandatory reading for premeds, by the way, with the rest of Taleb’s Incerto rounding out an advanced curriculum.  They would for sure have served me better than the anemic statistics textbooks I had to plough through in the early&amp;nbsp;‘00s.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s the reverse of a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_Broker"&gt;Power Broker&lt;/a&gt; hit job: in the reprint afterword, Lowenstein is wistful about not getting more praise from Buffet while the aforementioned is signing the author’s personal copy at a conference. How wonderful it would be if our heroes loved us as much as we love&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, Buffet is an easy person to love, what with being an aw-shucks Midwestern pro-government regulation democrat who is modest, smart, and also one of the richest people in world. That he first earned his money off of America’s addiction to sugar and shopping, followed by tobacco and war, followed by decidedly inegalitarian buddy deals, all while neglecting his wife to the point of her leaving, and his children to the point of their becoming New Age musicians, just supports his claim to being the most American of all American heroes.&amp;nbsp;Kudos.&lt;/p&gt;

It could have been a great movie for both children and adults, a Labyrinth for the age of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; and social justice. Instead, it’s a confused, hurried mess in which lots of Stuff happens for no good reason; a Michael Bay extravaganza for your middle-schooler. My daughter (6) liked it, but even she questioned a major plot point. “But, why did X become evil, daddy?” I’ve no idea, Honey, and I’m not sure the screenwriters gave it much thought&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such is the faith of many book adaptations; this one even more so, having had to pass through the Disney committee wringer. I haven’t read the book(s? That’s how much I know about the potential franchise) but I’ve read and watched enough fantasy to know that 1) your made-up world needs to have rules, and 2) if you break them, it better be for a good reason. The few week rules set in the Wrinkle’s first half are promptly broken at the half-time, with no explanation and nothing to replace them. Instead you get a holodeck of a planet, where anything can happen: hurricane in a haunted forest turns into a Stepford wives cul-de-sac turns into a crowded beach, and no there is nothing connecting those&amp;nbsp;dots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is too bad — each one of those scenes would’ve made a good episode for the second season of the unmade Wrinkle &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; show, perfect for Disney’s new streaming service. Such a&amp;nbsp;waste.&lt;/p&gt;

There are: the recombinant human (rh)&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IL&lt;/span&gt;-15, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IL&lt;/span&gt;-15/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IL&lt;/span&gt;-15Ralpha heterodimer (hetIL-15), and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALT&lt;/span&gt;-803, the “super-agonist”. You’re better of &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019"&gt;reading a more comprehensive review&lt;/a&gt;, but some highlights are&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The simplest, oldest, and seemingly most potent is the plain vanilla&amp;nbsp;rhIL-15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four dosing strategies have so far been tested: bolus (too toxic, &lt;a href="http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2014.57.3329"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;), subcutaneous (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, about as good as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALT&lt;/span&gt;-803 in increasing NKs and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD8&lt;/span&gt;+ T cells, &lt;a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2017/12/02/1078-0432.CCR-17-2451"&gt;also published&lt;/a&gt;), 10-day continuous infusion (the most potent, but who wants to sit in a hospital for 10 days, should be published soon), and a 5-day infusion (same 40-fold increase in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NK&lt;/span&gt; numbers in half the time! &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/miljko/status/1061004684759056385"&gt;presented at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SITC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of the patients in any of the regimens had a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RECIST&lt;/span&gt; response, but most mounted an impressive lymphocytosis, leading to several planned combination&amp;nbsp;trials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is available for investigator-initiated studies through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CTEP&lt;/span&gt;. They will also give a few vials for preclinical&amp;nbsp;studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis owns hetIL-15, and is running the phase I alone and in combination with their anti-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PD&lt;/span&gt;-1. Nothing published, but I’ll have more to say about it next&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALT&lt;/span&gt;-803 is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IL&lt;/span&gt;-15/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IL&lt;/span&gt;-15Ralpha heterodimer blessed with a single point mutation which confers upon it both increased binding to the common gamma chain, and validity to the claim of new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the only one shown to have efficacy as a single agent (&lt;a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/1957"&gt;though not in solid tumors&lt;/a&gt;), and the only one to be part of a published and/or presented combination (&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30148-7/fulltext"&gt;with nivolumab in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSCLC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and with rituximab in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FL&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s presented so far makes it less potent than rhIL-15 in increasing cell counts, but more convenient to give: via once-weekly subcutaneous injections for an 8-fold increase in&amp;nbsp;NKs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The company, Altor Biosciences, had been fairly open to IITs — one of them is currently open at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCI&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GU&lt;/span&gt; Malignancies Branch — but maybe not so much since being acquired in August 2018 by NantCell, a Patrick Soon-Shiong&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s more, of course, but I’ll end instead with another plug for &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; of cytokines in cancer&amp;nbsp;therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2018 22:47:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2018-11-15:/eng/2018/11/15/il-15-flavors/</guid></item><item><title>Yes, CAR-NK cells are exciting (as exciting as they can get after a phase I single-center yet-to-be-published trial)</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/13/car-nk-sitc/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For more than a year now, the big names of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-T-cell world have been sharing their excitement about the potential of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NK&lt;/span&gt; cells to be a much better &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; carrier. There are many hypotheses about why that would be, but you can hypothesize all you want until you give the product to humans. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PET&lt;/span&gt; scans can lie, but not nearly as much as your average transgenic mouse&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, anti-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD19CAR&lt;/span&gt;-NKs have now been given to at least 9 humans, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelodwyerMD/status/1061357814625591296"&gt;as reported by Dr. Katy Rezvani&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt; Anderson Cancer Center at the &lt;a href="https://www.sitcancer.org/education/annualmeeting"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SITC&lt;/span&gt; Annual Meeting&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, and what she reported was as good as it gets for a first-in-human trial of a new gene/cellular therapy. The five&amp;nbsp;takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Off-the-shelf cord blood-derived &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NK&lt;/span&gt; cells carrying a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; can safely be given to humans without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HLA&lt;/span&gt;-matching. This could decrease both cost and time to&amp;nbsp;treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stephaniecornen/status/1061365182373523456"&gt;None of the nine patients had cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity.&lt;/a&gt; After all, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NK&lt;/span&gt; cells aren’t big cytokine&amp;nbsp;producers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six of nine patients had a complete response and one more had a partial response for a 77% response&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrMiguelPerales/status/1061414200969494529"&gt;One of those CRs and one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; were patients with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLL&lt;/span&gt; and Richter’s transformation&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CR&lt;/span&gt; was in a 70-year-old with double-hit lymphoma, and yet another in a patient with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLL&lt;/span&gt; and 17p deletion. These are tough&amp;nbsp;diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contrary to what was hypothesized about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NK&lt;/span&gt; cell longevity, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-NKs persisted for up to six months after treatment. We still don’t know what that means for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-Ts, let alone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-NKs, but I consider it a win each time experiment refutes&amp;nbsp;theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes, I am also excited about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-NKs.&amp;nbsp;However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is an unpublished, non-peer-reviewed, single-center experience. There could be research hospitals out there giving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-NKs with results too horrible, or just too middle-of-the-road, for early&amp;nbsp;promotion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLL&lt;/span&gt; is notoriously difficult to stage, and five of the nine patients had &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLL&lt;/span&gt;. Consider &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1713976"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MURANO&lt;/span&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt; (Venetclax-Rituximab combo fo relapsed/refractory &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLL&lt;/span&gt;), in which the investigator-assessed complete response rate of 26.8% turned to 8.2% on independent review committee&amp;nbsp;assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow-up is limited and it is too early to know the response duration. Long enough to get to an allo transplant, at&amp;nbsp;least?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same limitations in target availability we have in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-T cells apply to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;-NKs. It has to be a surface antigen with limited to no expression on normal cells. There aren’t too many of those, particularly in solid&amp;nbsp;tumors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, kudos to Drs. Rezvani, Shpall, and others at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt; Anderson. This is as good as it gets at this early&amp;nbsp;stage. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2018 18:12:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2018-11-13:/eng/2018/11/13/car-nk-sitc/</guid></item><item><title>Ending medical reversal</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/12/ending-medical-reversal/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I picked up after taking the hematology boards was this gem from Chicago&amp;#8217;s medical royalty (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adamcifu"&gt;Adam Cifu&lt;/a&gt;) and everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite oncologist (this is of course a joke — you know that people hate your guts, &lt;a href="https://VPplenarysesh"&gt;Vinay&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t, and still don&amp;#8217;t, care much for the title. It is ambiguous: if medical reversal means overturning an established practice that was based on weak to no evidence once stronger evidence comes along — usually in the form of a (multi-center, blinded) randomized controlled trial — why on earth would you want to end reversals? Well, the book is about how to stop those kinds of practices from becoming established in the first place, which would indeed end medical reversal, but an easier way to stop them and one that would be endorsed by most of industry and many researches would be to just not look. &amp;#8220;Ending Medical Reversal the Hard Way&amp;#8221; is therefore a more appropriate&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Title aside, I agreed with pretty much everything they wrote, from reforming medical education, through stopping direct-to-consumer marketing and direct-to-academic (not their words) payments, to having more people participate in (simpler, cheaper, and fairer) randomized trials. I enjoyed their honesty and clear style, and wished my medical school had at least a passing resemblance to the one they proposed (if you thought &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; medical education leaned too much on basic science-oriented and was heavy in professorial mechanistic proclamations, try the average European med school). Granted, I work in a federal research hospital and focus on some of the rarest of the rare diseases; but that only makes me shake my head in disbelief more when my colleagues who specialize in breast or lung cancer, not to mention coronary artery disease and diabetes, randomize enormous numbers of patients to search for minute differences in surrogate&amp;nbsp;outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Which is good: surprise is overrated anyway, and things that depend on it don&amp;#8217;t do well on re-reading/watching/listening. I&amp;#8217;ll be coming back to this&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cowen argues that growth is good even when it doesn&amp;#8217;t benefit everyone all the time. There are things that can grow that you can&amp;#8217;t measure (like happiness, life satisfaction, health, culture, feeling of superiority [I may be misremembering some of these]), so don&amp;#8217;t focus on wealth only but instead on Wealth Plus. Also, distant future is just as important as the near future, so don&amp;#8217;t sacrifice long-term prospects for short-term gains. Speaking of future, we can&amp;#8217;t predict it, so even though tiny decisions can influence it in an oversized manner we should stop fretting over those and focus on the big picture: which is to chose policies that provide the greater sustained benefit sooner. Finally, common sense morality can usually steer you in the right direction, but if it feels like it&amp;#8217;s not, remember everything else in the book and you should be all&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all well and good, except that I kept imagining someone from Serbia — currently a second-world European kakistocracy — living by the standards of this book. Hilarity ensued: for things would be included in Wealth Plus that Cowen hadn&amp;#8217;t foreseen (the ability to redraw borders, to name one), and common sense morality would include good doses of nepotism, chauvinism, and the desire to cheat the state (yes, yes, I know,&amp;nbsp;#notallserbs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first thing that&amp;#8217;s keeping this book from being great is that it can&amp;#8217;t be universally applied — it was written by an American for his fellow Americans who have lost their way — and doesn&amp;#8217;t explore, or even mention, the implications of his vague concepts of Wealth Plus and common sense morality being different around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is that shortly after admitting that economists don&amp;#8217;t have crystal balls (the twelve-year-old me would have loved to put parentheses around &amp;#8220;crystal&amp;#8221;), he goes on to compare hypothetical policies based on their projected rates of growth well into the future. It may be my lack of an economic background speaking, but how can those two go&amp;nbsp;together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But do read the book. After my first pass I can say it&amp;#8217;s good, if not great. For me as a doctor the idea of delaying gratification for long-term gains felt familiar. The oncologist in me would add that inflicting harm for a known long-term benefit is also reasonable and depending on the alternatives even preferred. Of course, it took centuries of wading in the dark before medicine got to the point where it could with any certainty predict the outcome of its interventions. Are social sciences there&amp;nbsp;yet?&lt;/p&gt;

The title is seductive for those of us  who work with people’s very unengineered fleshy bits: would it help if we added some engineering tools to our mental toolbox? Well, maybe it would, but this book couldn’t help me find them, being more of an essay on &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; I should think like an engineer rather than an instruction manual on &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, you need a lot anecdotes anecdotes to explain the Why; stories zip by so fast they gave me whiplash. There are too many narratives and not enough thoughts: instead of just buttressing the main point or two, the anecdotes take center stage, sprinkled with outlines of different ideas that never become&amp;nbsp;central.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a book about engineering, I expected better&amp;nbsp;construction.&lt;/p&gt;

Obično se ispostavi da je neko sa polu-znanjem engleskom i potpunim neznanjem medicine probao da prevede nešto što je neko sa za nijansu većim znanjem oba napisao na osnovu nečijeg saopštenju za&amp;nbsp;štampu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zato, malo uputstvo za tumačenje vesti o medicinskim&amp;nbsp;istraživanjima:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako istraživanje nije na ljudima već na životinjama ili ćelijskim linijama, prestanite da&amp;nbsp;čitate;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako je istraživanje na ljudima ali se spominju reči kao “retrospektivno”, “intervju”, ili “ishrana”, prestanite da&amp;nbsp;čitate;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako vest o istraživanju dolazi sa konferencije za novinare a ne iz objavljenog rada, prestanite da&amp;nbsp;čitate;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako osoba koja piše vest nije potpisana imenom i prezimenom i nema iskustva u pisanju o medicini i nauci, prestanite da&amp;nbsp;čitate;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako u vesti nema komentara od lekara ili naučnika iz Srbije koji stavlja nova saznanja u kontekst srpske medicine, prestanite da&amp;nbsp;čitate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(svaka od ovih stavki zavređuje zaseban tekst, prve dve i nekoliko, ali život je&amp;nbsp;kratak)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bez konkretnih cifara, imam osećaj da je broj tekstova koje vredi čitati u dnevnim novinama i nedeljnicima o lepoti i zdravlju nula, a u malo ozbiljnijim nedeljnim i mesečnim listovima 1-2 godišnje. Što je samo za nijansu manje od broja objavljenih radova koji uopšte zavređuju pažnju&amp;nbsp;laika.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Feb 2018 12:22:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2018-02-07:/srb/2018/02/07/vesti-o-medicini/</guid></item><item><title>The death and life of great American cities</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2018/01/24/the-death-and-life-of-great-american-cities/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Jane Jacobs loved Greenwich Village so much that she wrote a book about why that was and why more neighborhoods weren’t like it. She looked at other similar areas in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. as well some failed ones, and gave a few guidelines on what was needed for safe, lively, and desirable city&amp;nbsp;streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has enough whimsical observations of city life to keep things interesting for its too-many—over 400—pages (e.g. on a city park’s homeless population: &lt;i&gt;Almost imperceptibly, like the hand of a clock, the raggle-taggle reception creeps around the circular pool at the center of the square. And indeed, it is the hand of a clock, for it is following the sun, staying in the warmth. &lt;/i&gt;Or, comparing a safe-but-dirty city street to a desired but decidedly unsafe park: &lt;i&gt;The sidewalks were dirty, they were too narrow for the demands put upon them, and they needed shade from the sun. But here was no scene of arson, mayhem or the flourishing of dangerous weapons. In the playground where the night-time murder had occurred, things were apparently back to normal too. Three small boys were setting fire under a wooden bench. Another was having his head beaten against the concrete. The custodian was absorbed in solemnly and slowly hauling down the American flag&lt;/i&gt;). It’s all quite&amp;nbsp;lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, it is an exercise in confirmation bias that misses as many essential points as it reveals. What was arguably the most devastating influence on American cities — Robert Moses — is but a misguided elderly official who, and kudos to him, knows his way around public funds. City planners like big, disruptive projects because of their bad (deductive!) reasoning, not because they give politicians photogenic ribbon-cutting&amp;nbsp;ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know why American cities are the way they are, better read &lt;i&gt;The Power Broker&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ray-Luke-Kylo triangle should have been a bigger part of the movie, but then many of the new characters, the ones that aren’t white and/or men, would have nothing to do.

&lt;li&gt;Vicevi o parceli za pijacu i parceli za ličnu upotrebu u srpskih seljaka pričaju su decenijama; siguran sam da je situacija sada bolja, pošto iza kvaliteta i čistoće hrane stoji jaka država (ha,&amp;nbsp;ha);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Država kontroliše i ispravnost vozila na putu (uključujući emisije gasova), protok otpadnih voda, kvalitet zemljišta oko deponija; jeste li bili skoro u&amp;nbsp;Pančevu?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zemljom tutnje putujući mamogrami, svaki muškarac stariji od 50 zna svoj &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSA&lt;/span&gt;, dok se kolonoskopije, Papa Nikolau testovi i &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; pluća kod pušača — jedine tri skrining metode za koje je pokazano da smanjuju smrtnost — ne rade uopšte, ili&amp;nbsp;sporadično;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postoje vakcine koje smanjuju incidencu nekih karcinoma (hepatitis B, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HPV&lt;/span&gt;) ali će vakcine izgleda biti sramna reč sve dok se dečija paraliza i male boginje ne vrate na velika&amp;nbsp;vrata;&lt;/li&gt;

Picture &lt;a href="http://www.da-vinci-inventions.com/aerial-screw.aspx"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci drawing helicopters&lt;/a&gt;: that’s the modern-day cancer researcher. The universal cure for cancer — and there should be one, if humanity survives long enough to create it — will not come from an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt; grant. If grants are involved at all, it will be something initially funded by the National Science Foundation. The current system of funding (government, non-profit, biotech, you name it) is broken, and if you account for the opportunity cost it is a complete disaster. Each of these statements deserves at least a paragraph, but I am saving my carpal tunnels for a manuscript, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOI&lt;/span&gt;, and a couple of protocols (oh, the&amp;nbsp;irony). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, a few things physician-scientists should do for the overall&amp;nbsp;good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find causes and create better prevention strategies, because a look at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEER&lt;/span&gt; database will tell you that it’s not just bad&amp;nbsp;luck;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eliminate barriers for administration of known curative therapies world-wide (do we really want to leave this to politicians and&amp;nbsp;economists?);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure &lt;em&gt;rapid&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;honest&lt;/em&gt; evaluation of the many new treatments, procedures, and diagnostic/prognostic methods coming out of the biomedical&amp;nbsp;behemoth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How beneficial any of this would be for one’s career is a different question altogether, but let’s not get into incentives because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSI&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Observe &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbMnBfiy6iFYce7cJRbZUVPvueGADTt3"&gt;the 1960s-1990s televised plays and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; dramas&lt;/a&gt;. I still have vivid memories of watching one particular &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt; the first time it aired, &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oic-oTVOc"&gt;about a Serbian family keeping in touch with their ex-pat relatives in Germany via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VHS&lt;/span&gt; tapes&lt;/a&gt;. Replace camcorders with smart phones and speed up the timeline to account for the internet, and it could have been shot today. Technology changes, people&amp;nbsp;don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HMr6sRAxl1GfI1vtEbznKzfQHEYQo5"&gt;My favorite childhood &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t aged well at all; then again has anything from the ‘90s? If you consider most of it was made during a civil war and in a time of hyperinflation it is actually quite good. What was 90210’s excuse? Better kids’ shows have been made in Serbia both &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HMr6sRAxkthNVJMLxJCcPCrndbXPJ_"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbMnBfiy6iH2TZq6DzM2fX485rDJcpdw"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best for last: the celebration of hard core nerddom that is Serbia’s longest-running quiz show, &lt;a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SlagalicaRTS"&gt;important enough to have its own channel&lt;/a&gt;. It starts with anagrams and math problems, makes a detour to Mastermind, then finishes off with three different ways to test for trivia. Jokes about the autism spectrum would be writing themselves if this were an American show, but it’s not, and (before I left, at least) Serbian viewers still had some admiration for the participants. It is all very serious and competitive, and has been on the air every weekday for the last 24 years. (A political side-note: this does not mean Serbia is free from anti-intellectualism, quite the opposite in fact. Some combination of militant anti-intellectuals, gas-lighters, and proponents of economic/financial scientism has been in positions of power since the early 90s. There are no lessons here, just&amp;nbsp;observations). &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2017 07:42:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-12-27:/eng/2017/12/27/brush-up-on-serbian/</guid></item><item><title>A few unpopular (in certain circles) opinions from a person who has no rights having them</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/12/24/unpopular-opinions-1/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, the American system of government is strong. Those who say otherwise have a financial interest in people thinking the&amp;nbsp;opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culturally, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has more similarities with Iran than with Saudi Arabia, even if you count religion and religiosity as part of culture. The Christian right is working hard to make them even more&amp;nbsp;similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though still quite hard, it’s easier for a high-skilled immigrant to come to America than to any other country in the world. Comparison is even more favorable for low-skilled and unskilled immigrants. For all of them, quality of life, acceptance, and protection they get are better than anywhere&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The randomness of the Green Card lottery process is a feature not a&amp;nbsp;bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the non-fiction sections of The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and whatever their conservative equivalents are, is good for generating fake insight but ultimately pointless. The Economist is useful for a tiny segment of the population but lets be real: if you’re reading this you are not&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only useful section in the daily newspapers is Local. Maybe Sports, if you are into that sort of thing, but professional and college sports are a scam so stick with the amateur&amp;nbsp;leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSA&lt;/span&gt; agents and airline personnel are nice people but some passengers check out their brains at the curb and make everyone’s lives less&amp;nbsp;pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple hardware products are underpriced for what you get but do you actually need what they offer? This doesn’t include the AirPods, which are the best thing Apple has made in the last 20 years and still underpriced; though they unfortunately resemble in both name and appearance &lt;a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/EarPod"&gt;a mind control method from Doctor Who S2&lt;/a&gt; and paired with a smart phone are not far from&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world doesn’t need another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPA&lt;/span&gt;. America needs more&amp;nbsp;tripels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all coming from a non-immigrant resident alien with no expertise in politics, international law, transportation, or technology.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversations with Tyler:&lt;/strong&gt; I much prefer this over his mostly spartan, often cryptic, and &lt;a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/12/seven-forbidden-words.html"&gt;always clueless about things medical&lt;/a&gt; blog Marginal revolution. Cowen‘s interview style brings out the best from people; it is also a good and rare example of clear thinking. Compare and contrast &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+EdFzVYa0A"&gt;his chat with Malcolm Gladwell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+EdFz2WcLQ"&gt;Patrick Collison’s chat with Cowen&lt;/a&gt;: when answering, Gladwell uhms and ahhs and changes direction mid-sentence; Cowen pauses for a half-second, then produces paragraphs of prose that could have been lifted right out of an encyclopedia. Not to belittle Gladwell —  for one, I’d be even worse (as anyone who had to finish my sentences for me can confirm); and two, he is responsible&amp;nbsp;for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revisionist history:&lt;/strong&gt; He had me at &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+Gsa28yPC8"&gt;Food Fight&lt;/a&gt;. Gladwell embraces and owns his &lt;em&gt;Well, actually&lt;/em&gt; kind of story-telling — even the show’s name is a big &lt;em&gt;Well, actually&lt;/em&gt; to the Gladwell-haters. And good for him, because the stories are marvelous in both topic and style, and make me want to read his books&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources and methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Two ex-spies talk about learning and cognition. They are still in  intelligence-gathering mode, interviewing guests you‘re unlikely to hear anywhere else. &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+DYZ4H4LSA"&gt;It’s how I learned about Tinderbox&lt;/a&gt; (and you can&amp;nbsp;too). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;America the bilingual:&lt;/strong&gt; One part &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+Iu8IpAoU4"&gt;pep-talk to encourage the pre-1990s waves of immigrants to America to take up a second language&lt;/a&gt;, one part &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+Iu8JtGW2s"&gt;advice to parents raising multilingual children&lt;/a&gt;. The latter validated my plan to ~~save money~~ strengthen the offspring’s Serbian by shipping them across the Atlantic to spend some quality time with the&amp;nbsp;grandparents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Finishing of the list of men talking to each other is the best oncology podcast I’ve come across. It may be &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+EcDGBRIqo"&gt;heavily slanted towards immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, and not zealous enough in dampening the hype, but it&amp;nbsp;tries.&lt;/li&gt;

Us humans are very good at finding patterns where none exist (&lt;a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a17529/a-short-history-of-martian-canals-and-mars-fever/"&gt;just ask Percival Lowell&lt;/a&gt;), so it is no wonder that we end up with an overarching story, albeit disjointed, which is — of course it is — steeped in New Age &lt;a href="https://meaningness.com/monism"&gt;monism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plot twist: unlike &lt;a href="http://digitalesammlungen.uni-weimar.de/viewer/image/PPN64011217X/1/#topDocAnchor"&gt;similar attempts in other arts&lt;/a&gt;, this one becomes wildly successful, serving as a template for other stories that end up following it more closely than any of the tales of old ever did (see &lt;a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers"&gt;Kevin Garvey’s literal and metaphorical travails&lt;/a&gt; for the most recent example). I like The Leftovers, so I would say The Hero… is a net benefit for the civilization. It just wasn’t for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure: I stopped reading the book near the end of the first (of two) sections, the one about The Hero’s Journey. I therefore never got to the Cosmogonic cycle, and cannot comment. Do let me know if there was a surprise&amp;nbsp;ending.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though only one of the three was meant to look bad in the movie, they each break a fundamental rule of the doctor-patient relationship: don’t be a douchebag, don’t sleep with the patient, don’t tell them everything will be fine when you have no clue. Cut out the profanities, and you’d have a semester’s worth of medical ethics&amp;nbsp;discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut out the profanities, though, and you’ll miss half the movie. Seth Rogen — a dirty old man trapped inside Fozzy the Bear — does what he’s been doing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5iaHTkpTv0"&gt;ever since Judd Apatow found him&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FNskZ6GQz2A"&gt;heart of gold included&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, 50/50 has better timing than anything to come out from the Apatow cringe factory, and even has a&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical miscellanea: was the diagnosing physician a medical oncologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, or an orthopedic surgeon? Likely not the first, else he wouldn’t give neoadjuvant cytarabine for a sarcoma, and probably not the latter two since another, overoptimistic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt; does the actual surgery. Can a psychologist perform interviews for what she admits will be her PhD thesis without getting informed consent? How can a surgeon say with any certainty that “everything will be fine” minutes after performing what she admitted to be a difficult operation &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301698002235"&gt;for a tumor with a relapse rate north of 50%&lt;/a&gt;. You know, the 50% that gave the movie its&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, thumbs&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

Trying to be deliberately inoffensive to a particular class of &lt;i&gt;consumer&lt;/i&gt;, it dodges &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v2exWrsGOc"&gt;Mickeydom’s most glorious moments of cultural sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; only to fall on the sword of blandness. But credit where it is due — it takes talent to make a trippy 60s comic book that’s oddly relevant in &lt;a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/03/14/maintaining-sanity-weird-timeline/"&gt;today’s world of magic mystery turmoil&lt;/a&gt; into a boring, predictable, dull, uninspired, yawn-inducing, delta wave-producing, paint-by-numbers origin&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you thought only the Strange-ness was fumbled you must not be a doctor, because &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/bUi8Youavz8"&gt;his day job features the most laughable medicine this side of the Human Centipede&lt;/a&gt;. Though I shouldn’t complain too much — I imagine aerospace engineers cringe an order of magnitude more when watching any other Marvel&amp;nbsp;miracle.&lt;/p&gt;

It is on the nose and at times painful to watch, but I would not expect anything else &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADJE5gat_W8"&gt;from the master of the afterschool special&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portman is a pro: she gets you to swallow the banal white swan/black swan analogy whole, and ask for more, goes through every exercise in Aronofsky’s mental torture playbook like it’s nothing, and looks believably cool and composed until she believably isn’t. Watching her in this movie makes a certain trilogy an even bigger crime against&amp;nbsp;directing.&lt;/p&gt;

Literally anyone (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jWEXGaupvlQ"&gt;yes, anyone&lt;/a&gt;) from the cast of Hamilton would have been a better choice for Bigeye’s partner. Heck, Justin Timberlake would have made more sense, being a human being of actual musical ability, and if you are forcing me to recommend &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TA0VnUGu62o?t=11s"&gt;Curly&lt;/a&gt; for a role in your movie, your have miscalculated&amp;nbsp;horribly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way Gosling would possibly have made sense was if you were making a point that anyone could sing, but then don’t make the character a musician, and better don’t do that movie at all since &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/wjohhUyfCeY?list=PL2rnwFFQ-ThgnmoVYthu3TNVQ1SCrVEIb"&gt;it had already been done much better on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; 15 years ago&lt;/a&gt; by a man who &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FTMuZSeSwIk"&gt;knows his musicals&lt;/a&gt;. And this is clearly not what Chazelle was trying to do, what with him incorporating &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JpCLxnVpgbo"&gt;high-level bizarre dance numbers&lt;/a&gt; and movie-making subplots reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin'_in_the_Rain"&gt;greatest American movie ever made&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emma Stone is a real jewel,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

The way it plays with space and time is admirable, and the law company of Keaton, Norton &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Stone does their job with perfection, but the subject matter is so far up Hollywood’s large intestine that &lt;i&gt;Birdman&lt;/i&gt; should best be compared to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/15JsYSZIT-Q?t=1m3s"&gt;another well-known continuous shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is on-your-nose pretentious, and artsy by design, yet too loaded with contemporary references to become timeless. Its one deep message — the one about criticism — was &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ih6jcKd7VwU"&gt;much better stated, and with a more positive attitude, a decade ago in an animated film about a rat&lt;/a&gt;.

It does set some standards of its own, most notably for dehumanizing the enemy, who is never given more than 10 seconds of film at a time and always with &lt;a href="http://j387mediahistory.weebly.com/anti-japanese-propaganda-in-wwii.html"&gt;a growling face straight out of a propaganda poster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a shame. The story of Desmond Doss as told in 2016 deserves better than a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WW2&lt;/span&gt; also-ran and &lt;a href="http://people.com/movies/the-true-story-of-hacksaw-ridge-and-desmond-doss-the-medal-of-honor-winner-who-never-fired-a-shot/"&gt;an illiterate journal article&lt;/a&gt;, for at least two reasons: he saved everyone he saw on the battlefield, American and Japanese; and no-one could get the number of people he helped straight, even as he was being given the Medal of Honor. Wondering how the other side thinks and feels, and sorting between truths, half-truths, and alt-truths are the themes of this decade, so it must have taken a lot of determination (or ignorance) on Braveheart’s part to ignore them so completely. Sort of like I’m ignoring Mel’s pet theme that wants to be central but can’t quite make&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;: Spiderman Jr. does his best doing Jimmy Stuart doing a pious army medic, and almost makes it. Vince Vaughn makes a good drill sergeant. This is not a failure of&amp;nbsp;acting.&lt;/p&gt;

Ironman’s vintage post-rehab quips are supposed to be endearing, but turn the movie into an annoying &lt;i&gt;Ally McBeal&lt;/i&gt; spinoff that’s even less sure of itself. Val Kilmer’s misshapen botoxed head mumbles through most of the lines, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KgSkCewy-LU?t=2m10s"&gt;though his penis features in a memorable scene&lt;/a&gt;. There are many more gags that are just as good, but are connected by a not well thought-out metaphor (is it a home movie on a reel? on tape? is it just playing in Downey’s head?) to make a twisty-turney plot that’s meant not to be followed (not unlike this&amp;nbsp;sentence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing Michele Monaghan is there to eat their lunch and make the movie&amp;nbsp;watchable.&lt;/p&gt;

Through symmetry, silence, and omission, that depressing premise — imagine having to be a teenager in Florida — never invokes depression. Compare and contrast to &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/"&gt;sad tales of straight white lower-middle class woes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since issues of identity, gender, and race are somewhat of a thing in this early 21st century, the movie is also a Rorschach test for its audience. A thousand opinion pieces bloomed in its wake, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxAKQoKORI&amp;t=6s"&gt;few of which as deep as a single scene&lt;/a&gt;, yet quite a bit more pretentious. Thousands more are to come in liberal arts colleges across the country, and deservedly so — many films tend to induce sympathy and elation in one particular group of people, awkwardness and shame in another, and this one time those two groups have&amp;nbsp;flipped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Parker&amp;#8217;s a young kid, pretty good on the sax, gets up to play at a cutting session, and he fucks it up. And Jones nearly decapitates him for it. And he&amp;#8217;s laughed off stage. But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices, and he practices with one goal in mind: Never too be laughed at again. And a year later he goes back to the Reno and he steps up on that stage and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world has ever heard. So imagine if Jones just said &amp;#8220;Well, that&amp;#8217;s okay Charlie. That was alright. Good job.&amp;#8221; Then Charlie thinks to himself &amp;#8220;Well, shit. I did do a pretty good job.&amp;#8221; End of story. No Bird. That, to me, is an absolute tragedy. But that&amp;#8217;s just what the world wants now. People wonder why jazz is dying. I&amp;#8217;ll tell you, man - and every Starbucks &amp;#8220;jazz&amp;#8221; album just proves my point, really - there are no two words in the English language more harmful than &amp;#8220;good job”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If delivering this dialogue gets you an award, how on Earth does writing it not also get you one? Never mind the precise shots, impeccable pace, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/-Vb5G8xjc_0"&gt;midpoint that could have been a short movie on its own&lt;/a&gt;, and the adrenaline-surge-inducing ending that is musical, cinematic, and deeply philosophical all at once. Movies at their&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;

Since novelty may be the only thing that counts in what is bracketed as SciFi — &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/movie/interstellar"&gt;look at &lt;i&gt;Interstellar&lt;/i&gt; being undeservedly panned&lt;/a&gt; — a movie whose emotional range begins and ends with a side plot of a dying child now has a shot at the Academy Award. Also, and it feels wrong to even have to write this, there are other ways to elicit emotion in your audience than killing off children, &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/"&gt;dear movie-makers of 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect where it is due: passing of Hawkeye as a plausible physicist — by having him not talk about physics the entire movie, but still — and floating the idea of world unification in anno domini 2017 are admirable feats. Not enough to offset the hours wasted on walking through a hallway and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzFnckanHQKM9BV3L8Msbx03OzdIu_78"&gt;80s-style montages&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Denis Villeneuve, &lt;i&gt;2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2017 08:13:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-02-25:/eng/2017/02/25/arrival/</guid></item><item><title>Manchester by the Sea</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A dour movie about dour people living dour lives in a dour New England town. The camera is static and so are our hero’s faces. Long periods of voyeuristic shots of everyday life are punctuated by rare expressions of minimal emotion. Answers to all our questions are quickly revealed and dramatic tension never builds&amp;nbsp;up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kind of direction is fine if you are &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vGvDCmuDKKE"&gt;talking about a man’s mid-life crisis&lt;/a&gt;, but disturbing when your movie involves three children burning to death. Is seeing a couple of good acting performances worth subjecting yourself to emotional trauma that doesn’t result in a meaningful message (and anything on stoicism of the Irish can hardly count &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JATICtPYGGI"&gt;if the Simpsons have already done it&lt;/a&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical things of note: &lt;i&gt;congestive heart failure&lt;/i&gt; is a diagnosis as broad as &lt;i&gt;lower back pain&lt;/i&gt; (i.e. not a real diagnosis at all); would anyone not work it up further, never mind that it is in an otherwise healthy 40-something; and do they not have ICDs in Manchester, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/779blnz0JU8"&gt;Coach&lt;/a&gt; should not have died, least of all because without his death we wouldn’t have had this&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Kenneth Lonergan, &lt;i&gt;2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 06:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-02-23:/eng/2017/02/23/manchester-by-the-sea/</guid></item><item><title>Looper</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/02/19/looper/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Although a movie that involves traveling through time, Looper is hardly a time-travel movie. Bruce Willis says as much when he brushes off any attempts to discuss the mechanics, implications, paradoxes, etc. for reasons of expediency. So, &lt;a href="https://www.xkcd.com/657/"&gt;Primer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/204"&gt;Predestination&lt;/a&gt;, or even Back to the Future &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; this ain’t. Groundhog Day is more like it, only with shotguns, telekinesis, and a far messier&amp;nbsp;ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s unfortunate for me, since I prefer pure time-travel movies; and there isn’t enough — or any, really — Bill Murray in Looper to justify comparing it to that other category. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JGL&lt;/span&gt; spends too much time pretending to be Willis, who in turn phones it in. Elevator/hallway action scenes are good, but don’t come close to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBwvIX7Sao"&gt;the peak of the genre&lt;/a&gt; (or even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cSUsBzE-Wuo"&gt;the western take&lt;/a&gt;, which was fundamentally a feature-length interpretation of that one scene from&amp;nbsp;Oldboy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is, in fact, nothing new to see here, and the movie feels as flat as the Kansas plain it is set in. The one interesting thing about it is that, in what is the complete opposite of &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/21/brick/"&gt;the director’s previous movie&lt;/a&gt;, Looper might be better appreciated in a&amp;nbsp;vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

The future’s clean, white, Apple-y aesthetic was annoying enough for me not to feel too badly after it imploded, and the humans of the future were just as grating, but I assume that was one of the big points Liu wanted to make (that we are more closely related temporally than we are geographically or genetically, that is, not that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ydkvO6C9pTs"&gt;Jony Ive is a future-human&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point: a book about humanity’s impending demise has a good quarter of it dedicated to one man’s delusions about art and love. Those passages end up being directly relevant to the plot, but if anything, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OVCxJ1aT24A"&gt;that takes away from them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the character who ends up being the book’s main proponent of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poverty_of_Historicism"&gt;historicism&lt;/a&gt; dies in the best standoff &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4GAQtGtd_0"&gt;since the Gotham prisoners’ dilemma&lt;/a&gt;, which ends up being only the second-best of the many standoffs the book presents. It is a beautiful, self-referential standoff&amp;nbsp;heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s one of Tim Burton’s better Tim Burton&amp;nbsp;movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, yes, the plot has holes, and some of the characters’ motivations are… peculiar (har har). The more important thing is this: after seeing it, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/V_fOn_aWCNk"&gt;Dora wanted to fly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out, the generation gap is only a setup for the real fight — that of &lt;a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/09/01/the-origin-of-authenticity-in-the-breakdown-of-the-illusion-of-the-real/"&gt;authentic versus fake&lt;/a&gt;.  It culminates with (old, authentic) Ben Stiller neurotically rollerblading into Lincoln Center, hoping for a catharsis after he reveals to his documentary film-making giant of a father-in-law that (young, fake) Kylo Ren based parts of his own documentary on&amp;nbsp;alt-facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Things change”, replies &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0499002/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t21"&gt;Mr. Breitbart&lt;/a&gt;, minutes after giving a speech on honesty in filmmaking. “Different things matter&amp;nbsp;now.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, mom kills herself while hospitalized for depression far away in New Mexico, a road trip ensues, thoughts, feelings, and inadequacies of their lifestyle are exposed. The setup is better than the second act, during which 1) the captain of the freshly single-parent household is predictably un-fantastic, and 2) the middle-crassness of his extended family is blown out of all proportion. The payoff is better — if nothing else, it will make its &lt;a href="https://silverbirchpress.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/pick-up-lines-new-yorker-cartoon-by-frank-modell/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;-reading audience&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Directed by &lt;/i&gt;Matt Ross, &lt;i&gt;2016&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2017 07:26:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-01-29:/eng/2017/01/29/captain-fantastic/</guid></item><item><title>How to write a thesis</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/28/how-to-write-a-thesis/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Umberto Eco’s rules and advice on how Italian university students of modest means should choose a relevant topic, conduct and organize research with limited resources, and format their final undergraduate thesis. Though created by and for someone in the humanities, much of it applies to all sciences — and the parts that don’t are at least&amp;nbsp;entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was written in 1977, revised in 1985, and revised again when translated to English for both cultural and temporal/technological adjustments. &lt;a href="http://diplomski-rad-kako-napisati.blogspot.rs"&gt;A translation to Serbian (which is, amazingly, freely available online)&lt;/a&gt; needed neither, as &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/family-fiefdoms-blamed-for-tainting-italian-universities-2089120.html"&gt;Serbia and Italy have similarly dysfunctional systems of higher education&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a book whose most important section is the one on taking notes and organizing research, this edition has remarkably small margins and tight binding. No matter — it will feature prominently in the Acknowledgments section of my PhD thesis, if and when I finish&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Written by &lt;/i&gt;Umberto Eco, &lt;i&gt;1977&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jan 2017 17:33:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2017-01-28:/eng/2017/01/28/how-to-write-a-thesis/</guid></item><item><title>They Came Together</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2017/01/26/they-came-together/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The difference between loving homage and gross parody can be subtle, and what the movie ends up being usually depends on whether the author(s) actually like the genre they are spoofing. It is an easy guess, for example, that Edgar Wright likes &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVsL9tUJLHs"&gt;zombie apocalypses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH-CvYpoSUo"&gt;buddy cop movies&lt;/a&gt;, or that Joss Whedon is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufF5p8VBsVk&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqo7ZL09v0c2VLxvak-8uUaR"&gt;into horror films&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who made this thing must truly hate romantic comedies. It doesn’t wink at &lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy"&gt;rom-com tropes&lt;/a&gt; — it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sqb85Gfj0Fw&amp;index=4&amp;list=PLZbXA4lyCtqpFIO718l2rS3eypRgtgLPh"&gt;blows them out of all proportion&lt;/a&gt;, the acting is even cheesier, camera work blander. I could pick out clips for these, but its’s the entire movie. Moreover, the comedies it references are dated, going with &lt;i&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/i&gt; (1989), &lt;i&gt;You’ve Got Mail &lt;/i&gt;(1998), and &lt;i&gt;Notting Hill&lt;/i&gt; (1999) over the more recent and even more ridiculous &lt;i&gt;Love Actually&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K45RdE2qlk"&gt;interconnected plot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_dt27_0vL4"&gt;wannabes&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pd-MpXCMcIs"&gt;the jokes are just too obvious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making fun of something &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Every+Romantic+Comedy+Ever"&gt;that is easy to make fun of&lt;/a&gt; is easy. Making a good movie that is also a parody is hard. &lt;i&gt;They Came Together&lt;/i&gt; (ha ha) is a decent&amp;nbsp;parody.&lt;/p&gt;

Roose Bolton is again to blame, in a way, but has more sense at the end of this one while leaving room for a sequel (The Autopsy 2: Richmond Horror, a working title that I just made up, so you can stop googling&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice—if short—ride that would be much scarier for those who never attended an autopsy, but between the pacing, the acting, and the near-absence of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8znuHwF490"&gt;jump scares&lt;/a&gt;, it’s the best horror movie I’ve seen since &lt;i&gt;It follows&lt;/i&gt;. It gets extra points for being truer to the genre—&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ietK_lZyDNY"&gt;no hipster soundtracks here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And no, you can’t put a think chunk of freshly brain under a microscope and see cells, much less figure out if a neuron is alive just by looking at it for 1.5 seconds. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9dw9BweRQk"&gt;Brian Cox can sell anything&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

This &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;i&gt;film noir&lt;/i&gt;, complete with a Gordian knot of a plot, gritty textures half-concealed in darkness, and telegraphed archetypes (the loner, the vamp, the &lt;i&gt;femme fatale&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teenagers seem parentless—save for a comic relief scene or two featuring the mom of our archetypal kingpin serving the boys cookies and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OJ&lt;/span&gt;—and the few other adults in the world treat them as equals. Clearly a fantasy, but you will have suspended your disbelief long before&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It fares well when compared to the competition—but then, most of it had been made in the 1940s, so I wouldn’t call it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDyFh0x_ygM"&gt;a fair fight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

It is the 1960s—why waste money on tuition if her only reason for attending university is to find a good&amp;nbsp;husband?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She likes his opera-champaign-trips-to-Paris lifestyle, he likes that she speaks French and looks at him like a God, so it looks like a win-win-win as she abandons high school for an engagement ring. But if you hang around scammers you will get scammed, and soon she learns he has a wife, a son, and countless past &lt;i&gt;jeunes femmes&lt;/i&gt; like her, some of whom ended up with child. A &lt;i&gt;deus ex machina&lt;/i&gt; in the form of an English teacher does help her get into Oxford, and she lives long and well enough to be able to write &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Education-Lynn-Barber/dp/1934633852/"&gt;the memoire that Nick Hornby turned into this screenplay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a masterpiece, but serviceable as educational material for preteens. I hope Dora will grow up not to be as impressionable to&amp;nbsp;sleazeballs.&lt;/p&gt;

It uses a broad brush—with not much description or characterization—to explore such trivialities as life, reality, human perception, and humanity’s place in the&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of it has a sense of odd turning into familiar: the bloodshed of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution"&gt;the Chinese Cultural Revolution&lt;/a&gt; projected onto the book’s pro-alien human factions and real world’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement"&gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement"&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter"&gt;alike&lt;/a&gt; movements; virtual realities inside a nesting doll of x-dimensional spaces &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZgBcRhGPqs"&gt;that may themselves be virtual&lt;/a&gt;; environmental dangers, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity"&gt;imagined&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"&gt;real&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing_final.pdf"&gt;Einstein supposedly pictured himself chasing a beam of light&lt;/a&gt; before developing his theories of relativity. Liu imagined standing on the surface of a planet quite unlike Earth to come to this book and its two siblings. Based on the first installment, I can tell that investing some time in the trilogy will be worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

Too well. Between Brexit, Zika, islamist fundamentalists, and police brutality, 2017 is much closer to the version of 2027 the movie portrays than what Cuaron could possibly have imagined while writing and directing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brilliant long tracking shots include &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfBSncUspBk"&gt;Juliane Moore’s bloody demise in a post-apocalyptic British mini-car&lt;/a&gt;, and Clive Owen’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twcKoAQ7HIg"&gt;race through a desolate seaside town-slash-rebellious refugee camp&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBzWTIexszQ"&gt;find the only baby alive on Earth&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the movie could now be described as &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sneakysnackhobo/v/115812094"&gt;a Twitch video&lt;/a&gt;, though back then first-person shooters were &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IE46AFOqrC8"&gt;decidedly less realistic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this were Interstellar, Owen would have lived through the end and be reunited with a resurrected Moore. Fortunately, it is&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observations about our new neighborhood from a Serbian/European/Baltimorean&amp;nbsp;transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs are&amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runners and cyclists&amp;nbsp;too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a couple of homeless people. One seems to have staked out a bench I pass by every&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few children. Assuming all the little Audreys and Maddisons are attending their ballet lessons, or&amp;nbsp;whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants with street seating. It&amp;#8217;s like I&amp;#8217;m back in Belgrade. Alas, most of them serve nothing but greasy American classics, only they call it Southern-style and put even more&amp;nbsp;grease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are people who eat at these places the same ones doing all the&amp;nbsp;running?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do two different streets in the same neighborhood have the exact same name? If you put a super-block that cuts a road in half, does it not make sense to rename one of&amp;nbsp;them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a house officer and installing one of the first right-heart
catheters, the machine that showed intrapulmonic arterial pressures was
enormous and was equipped with strain gauges rather than computer chips.
Making it work was difficult. After the line was in, the attending, the
nurse, and I tried desperately to adjust the machine to show the pulmonary
arterial pressure waves. We could not get them. The line on the screen
remained flat. We manipulated toggle switches and strain gauges for about 15
minutes. Nothing. Finally, I glanced at the patient: He was&amp;nbsp;dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neće doći do holivudske katastrofe u kojoj za par dana planeta ostaje pod vodom. Čorba koju smo zakuvali sporo se greje, a homo sapiens je prilagodljiva vrsta (mi smo u toj priči žabe, ako analogija nije bila dovoljno&amp;nbsp;jasna).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Srbija nema izlaz na more. Ono što ima su: sa jedne strane razvijene zemlje koje već imaju ili prave planove za odbranu od poplava i na dovoljnom su nivou razvoja da prežive, a sa druge milioni ugroženih koji će želeti da promene mesto prebivališta. To neće biti problem danas, pa ni u sledećih 10-20 godina, ali verovatno hoće za životnog veka moje&amp;nbsp;generacije.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pošto se ništa strašno neće desiti tokom mandata bilo koje sada zamislive vlade, srpski političari uvek mogu da slegnu ramenima—biračko pamćenje doseže par meseci unazad, a budućnost se proteže do sledeće plate. Sve i da neko postavi to pitanje, ovo je jedna od retkih situacija u kojoj najveći deo krivice može da se prebaci na nekog drugog—Amerika i Kina su najveći zagađivači, Rusija i Zapadna Evropa ne zaostaju. Pošto pređašnje iskustvo govori da se u kriznim situacijama mediji u Srbiji—a preko njih i javnost—više bave odgovornošću nego rešenjima, problem klimatskih promena će zauvek biti među poslednjima na političkoj listi&amp;nbsp;prioriteta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Što je šteta, jer će one dokrajčiti Srbiju pre bilo koje bele kuge, tropskih virusa, Velike Albanije, i širenja &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NATO&lt;/span&gt;-a.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2016 14:32:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-02-23:/srb/2016/02/23/na-ivici/</guid></item><item><title>Submitted without comment</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2016/02/23/submitted-without-comment/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/opinion/sunday/cancer-and-climate-change.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&amp;amp;smid=nytcore-iphone-share" title="New York Times: Cancer and Climate Change"&gt;→ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;: Cancer and Climate&amp;nbsp;Change&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the government asking&amp;nbsp;for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation wants to examine the iPhone used by Syed Farook to determine whether he and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, had planned the shooting directly with the Islamic State. The iPhone, a 5c version of the smartphone that was released in 2013, is locked by a passcode, which the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;F.B.I.&lt;/span&gt; wants Apple to circumvent. Apple would have to build a new version of its iOS smartphone software that allows the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;F.B.I.&lt;/span&gt; to bypass certain restrictions. Apple claims this software can give someone “the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone’s physical&amp;nbsp;possession.”&lt;/p&gt;

Telefon &amp;#8220;ajfon 5C&amp;#8221; zaključan je šifrom od nekoliko cifara, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FBI&lt;/span&gt; zahteva od &amp;#8220;Epla&amp;#8221; da otključa telefon kako bi organi vlasti mogi da ga ispitaju. Štaviše, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FBI&lt;/span&gt; zahteva da &amp;#8220;Epl&amp;#8221; razvije novi softver koji bi dozvoljavao organima vlasti da otključavaju telefone onih osoba koje smatraju sumnjivim, što kompanija kategorički odbija da&amp;nbsp;uradi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Intelligent-Touchstone/dp/0671212095"&gt;How to read a book&lt;/a&gt;, by Mortimer J.&amp;nbsp;Adler&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to start learning about learning than by reading a book about reading&amp;nbsp;books?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Farnam Street blog has &lt;a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/how-to-read-a-book/" title="Farnam Street blog: How to read a book"&gt;a nice outline of the book&amp;#8217;s main
ideas&lt;/a&gt;. The same establishment is now hocking a $200 course on the
same topic. It&amp;#8217;s probably good, but at $10 the source material is slightly more&amp;nbsp;affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/"&gt;Getting things done&lt;/a&gt;, by David&amp;nbsp;Allen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few months you will be neck-deep in scut work no matter what you do. After that, though, you will have to juggle patient care, research, didactics, fellowship/career planning, and piles of administrative drek—and that&amp;#8217;s just inside the hospital. At the very least, this book will help you make time for laundry (and maybe some&amp;nbsp;reading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555"&gt;Thinking, fast and slow&lt;/a&gt;, by Daniel&amp;nbsp;Kahneman&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superficially, similar knowledge to what is in these 400+ pages can be found &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" title="Wikipedia: Cognitive biases"&gt;in
a few Wikipedia entries&lt;/a&gt;. But you would miss out on the how and why cognitive biases and heuristics are so important. Medicine and research are bias-driven endeavors, and not understanding them is not knowing real-world&amp;nbsp;medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only three? Yes. If anything, the two and a half months between mid-March and July 1st won&amp;#8217;t be enough to read them all with the attention they deserve. But you should&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2016 13:57:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-02-18:/eng/2016/02/18/level-up/</guid></item><item><title>Gutenberg</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2016/02/18/gutenberg/</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="http://ift.tt/1Klxkw2"&gt;→ Da li možete da pogodite kakvo nas vreme očekuje do kraja&amp;nbsp;nedelje?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kurir.rs/vesti/drustvo/senzacionalno-otkrice-americkih-lekara-s-novom-metodom-lecenja-kod-cak-94-odsto-umirucih-pacijenata-rak-je-nestao-clanak-2137153" title="Još jedna Kurirova bljuvotina"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SENZACIONALNO&lt;/span&gt; OTKRIĆE AMERIČKIH &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEKARA&lt;/span&gt; Novom metodom lečenja 94 odsto pacijenata izlečeno od&amp;nbsp;raka!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostatak teksta nije ništa bolji od&amp;nbsp;naslova.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problemi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Izvor nije objavljena studija, već preliminarni podaci predstavljeni na relativno malom skupu kao deo dužeg predavanja o himeričnim antigen receptor (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;nbsp;T-ćelijama.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pacijenti nisu imali bilo koji &amp;#8220;rak&amp;#8221;, već akutnu limfoblastičnu&amp;nbsp;leukemiju.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;94% ih nije bilo izlečeno, već su ušli u remisiju; razlika je&amp;nbsp;velika.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metoda je relativno nova, ali su rezultati primene iste terapije kod iste grupe pacijenata (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt;) već objavljeni, prvo sa Univerziteta u Pensilvaniji (U. Penn), uglavnom kod dece, a zatim iz &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt;-a. Sijetl definitivno nije&amp;nbsp;prvi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da rezimiramo: iz parafraziranog naslova &amp;#8220;Američki lekari otkrili novu
metodu koja je izlečila 94% pacijenata sa rakom&amp;#8221; tačno je jedino to da
su u pitanju američki lekari (mogu da im priznam i pola poena za &amp;#8220;rak&amp;#8221;,
mada je ta opšta izjava opasnija od čiste&amp;nbsp;laži).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A šta se zna: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; T-ćelije su prvo stvorene u laboratorijama &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt;-a, a zatim
prvi put primenjena na ljudima—i to deci sa akutnom leukemijom—na U. Penn-u,
daleko od Sijetla. &lt;a href="http://www.phillymag.com/articles/carl-june-key-fighting-cancer/" title="Has Carl June Found a Key to Fighting Cancer?"&gt;Poduži (i jako dobar) tekst
o tome&lt;/a&gt; su lokalne novine objavile pre više
od dve godine. U. Penn i &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt; su jedini do sada objavili rezultate. Na Fred Hač se još&amp;nbsp;čeka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upotreba ovakvih ćelija je ograničena na bolesti sa relativno
uniformnim malignim ćelijama koje ne mutiraju puno—dakle pretežno
hematološkim malignitetima. Kod dece sa &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt;-om koja uđu u remisiju
bolest se u najvećem broju slučajeva vraća posle godinu-dve, tako da
se pretpostavlja da je za izlečenje potrebna transplantacija koštane
srži odmah nakon terapije &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAR&lt;/span&gt; ćelijama. Ne postoji dovoljno podataka za
odrasle, mada oni obično prolaze lošije od&amp;nbsp;dece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sva tri centra rade sa različitim farmaceutskim kompanijama na
komercijalizaciji terapije—otuda česta objavljivanja nedopečenih
rezultata posle kojih akcije idu gore-dole. Pacijenti u Americi uvek
imaju šansu da se prijave za neko od ovih istraživanja i besplatno
dobiju eksperimentalnu terapiju. Misterija je zašto Kurir ovakvim
naslovima potpaljuje lažne nade obolelih u&amp;nbsp;Srbiji.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Feb 2016 11:37:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-02-17:/srb/2016/02/17/a-od-nekih-stvari-mi-pozli/</guid></item><item><title>Defamacija, difamacija, kleveta</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2016/02/16/dedifamacija/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Moje kopanje po novoj srpskoj literaturi se nastavlja.

&lt;p&gt;Da budemo sasvim jasni - nije dobro da Politika defamira i izlaže Istinomer

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istina je da Jelena P. nije koristila eksplicitno difamatorski jezik, i da se
uglavnom potrudila da „tekst“ (za razliku od veoma jakog „podteksta“, na koji

neutralno: evo vam suve činjenice, pa vi sami izvlačite&amp;nbsp;zaključke… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;#8217;s not your browser. The list is&amp;nbsp;empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 10 years of attaching electric appendages to my head using flimsy
earhooks some call ear-phones, I have decided that one voice in my head
at a time is quite enough, thank you, and that there are better ways
to muffle the sounds of everyday existence than the nasal overtones of
middle-aged white&amp;nbsp;men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who will be crushed to lose me as a listener, I am&amp;nbsp;sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t suddenly decided that they are all &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, mind you—I have
spent cumulative &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; listening to them, so they &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be good. The
problem is, I like them too&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold my modified &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAGE_questionnaire" title="Wikipedia entry for the CAGE questionnaire"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAGE&lt;/span&gt; questionnaire&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;podcasts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever felt you needed to Cut down on your time spent listening to podcasts? &lt;em&gt;Doing it right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your listening to podcasts at inappropriate times? &lt;em&gt;Does my wife count as&lt;/em&gt; people&lt;em&gt;? If so, then&amp;nbsp;yes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever felt Guilty about listening to a podcast instead of doing something else? &lt;em&gt;You mean like sitting in the car 10 extra minutes after coming back home from work, waiting for an episode of &lt;/em&gt;Radiolab&lt;em&gt; to finish?&amp;nbsp;Umm…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you ever felt you needed to put on your headphones first thing in the morning (Eye-opener) to finish listening to last night&amp;#8217;s podcast, or to get a head start on completing the unplayed list. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Felt like?&amp;#8221; I do it all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aced&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, being mostly free, not too hard on your body, sometimes
educational, and often entertaining, podcasts are not the
worst thing in the world to be addicted to. But to be alone
with your thoughts is exceedingly rare when there is a toddler
in the house—rare enough that you do not want to spoil it by
introducing external stimuli which make it impossible to string a
chain of thought longer than the 30-second commercial break for

&lt;p&gt;Farewell, voices. It was good while it&amp;nbsp;lasted.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 14:16:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-02-11:/eng/2016/02/11/podcast-time/</guid></item><item><title>Storytellers</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2016/02/08/storytellers/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I shared a brief reflection on a tiny aspect of my commute.
&lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2016/02/04/the-707-train/" title="Infinite regress • The 7:07 train dilemma"&gt;Please check it out it if you haven&amp;#8217;t already&lt;/a&gt;, it is a quick&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;#8217;t that nice? It started by introducing some old concepts in a
new light—you knew about trains before, and maybe even knew there was
a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MARC&lt;/span&gt; Penn that line goes from Baltimore to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, but probably didn&amp;#8217;t
know the specific trains and their timetables. Then it gave you a
coherent explanation of a phenomenon you hadn&amp;#8217;t known about before. This
first caused slight, but not unpleasant, cognitive strain while you
were figuring out what I writing about, followed by the small pleasure
of an ah-hah moment once the pieces&amp;nbsp;clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a brain massage, if you will. It was also complete&amp;nbsp;bull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that anything I wrote was wrong, as far as I know, but I didn&amp;#8217;t
give many arguments for it being right, either. There were no ridership
statistics or arrival times to back up my claims. And even if there
were—I didn&amp;#8217;t give any alternative hypotheses to explain the situation,
nor reasons why those would be less likely than my own explanation. When
you think about it, it was more of a brain Twinkie than a massage—all
empty calories, with a fleeting feeling of&amp;nbsp;fullness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to 99.99999% of the written word, and to anything ever spoken
out&amp;nbsp;loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like stories. They need to make a threshold amount of sense (this is
why societies universally ostracize schizophrenics). They should contain
an element of surprise (it is not that the 7:07 train would come &lt;em&gt;later&lt;/em&gt;
than the 7:23—twists like that do not surprise anyone any more—it is
that it comes in &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; earlier because people think it wouldn&amp;#8217;t). And
they get bonus points if—as my last parenthetical implied—they paint
&lt;em&gt;the others&lt;/em&gt; as stupid or incompetent. There are many more checkboxes;
more of them checked, the better the&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most professions are based on storytelling. Doctors tell different
stories to their patients, each other, and themselves—as do most other
scientists, to a different degree. Lawyers tell stories to their clients
to make them believe they will craft good ones for the judge, jury, and
the opposing side. Ask a marketer what makes a good commercial (spoiler:&amp;nbsp;story).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a coal miner doesn&amp;#8217;t involve telling stories. No one wants to be a
coal&amp;nbsp;miner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our minds prefer a good story over a true one, and will have us believe
it more, too. However, the more boxes you see checked, the more
suspicious you should be that someone manipulated the tale to make it
more pleasurable, ergo memorable, ergo&amp;nbsp;believable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(So, if what you&amp;#8217;ve just read made&amp;nbsp;sense…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for an objective truth—or getting as close to it
as possible—any medium that involves audio/visual queues will be an
impediment. Sights and sounds stir up emotions, and emotions prime us to
believe or not to believe. Pay attention to the background music in a
documentary, or how the desk of that shifty lawyer they&amp;#8217;re interviewing
is a complete&amp;nbsp;mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; news is, of course, a joke—this is why comedy shows are becoming the
most popular delivery&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written word has its own way of deceiving—anecdotes, incomplete data,
misquotes, &lt;a href="http://m.sss.sagepub.com/content/44/4/638.full"&gt;lazy references&lt;/a&gt;—all to make a better narrative. Just read
anything by Malcolm Gladwell. And look at the time it takes to get
to the bottom of just one tiny factoid in that story of the iron
content in spinach. Finding truth is exhausting and exasperating, and people whose
job it is to find it (hello, accountants) are way less fun than those
who make stuff up. Mark Twain said it&amp;nbsp;best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its&amp;nbsp;shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misquoted? &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cindy-lovell/thats-what-he-said-quotin_b_4282800.html"&gt;Most likely.&lt;/a&gt; Or is Huff Post wrong? It wouldn&amp;#8217;t be the first&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing in this post that bigger and better minds than my own &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Acognitive%20bias"&gt;haven&amp;#8217;t
written about already&lt;/a&gt;. But
that&amp;#8217;s a boatload of pages! Not many people have the time, discipline,
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; interest to read all that—and even if they did, they would keep
making the same mistakes over again, as shown in several studies
described in those same books (yes, yes, all studies are flawed; one
windmill at a time, please). These things are hard-wired, and for a good
reason—evolution doesn&amp;#8217;t care for objective&amp;nbsp;truths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe it does. I don&amp;#8217;t know, I&amp;#8217;ve just made it&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 13:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-02-08:/eng/2016/02/08/storytellers/</guid></item><item><title>Also, this is happening</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2016/02/04/the-switch/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/things-omnifocus.jpg" alt="Switching to Omnifocus" width="800")&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it may happen, eventually, when I get to it. Probably close to the trial
expiration date, if&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2016 06:56:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-02-04:/eng/2016/02/04/the-switch/</guid></item><item><title>The 7:07 train dilemma</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2016/02/04/the-707-train/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a screen grab of the the &lt;a href="http://mta.maryland.gov/schedules/display.php?route=penn_southbound.xls" title="Marc Penn Southbound"&gt;Marc Penn line southbound schedule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marc Penn Southbound" src="/images/marc-southbound.png =800x139"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note train 415, departing Baltimore Penn at 7:00 (I get on at West
Baltimore, so in my mind it&amp;#8217;s the 7:07 train). Also note train 517—my
7:23, and the times they both arrive at Washington Union&amp;nbsp;Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it ever worth taking the&amp;nbsp;7:07?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, yes.&amp;nbsp;Because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most commuters look at the schedule and make the same conclusion that you probably did: waking up at least 16 minutes earlier in the morning is not worth the 7 minute lead time you get in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With that in mind, even if they leave early they don&amp;#8217;t really rush to the 7:07; therefore significantly fewer people need to get in at each stop compared to the 7:23 and it usually gets to Union slightly ahead of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of more people waiting on the 7:23 it tends to limp along in the last few stops and doesn&amp;#8217;t get to Union until 8:15 in the best of&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 15-20 minute difference does mean a lot if you have to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s abysmal metro which gets crowded by the minute between 8 and&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the sorts of things you think about when your commute is almost two
hours each way. If you would like to read more about extreme commuting (and who
wouldn&amp;#8217;t?), &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/04/16/there-and-back-again" title="The New Yorker: There and Back Again"&gt;this old New Yorker article is a good place to start&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2016 06:36:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-02-04:/eng/2016/02/04/the-707-train/</guid></item><item><title>Yes, but why?</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2016/01/04/why/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This website&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a public repository of articles, lectures, and other original works I authored or&amp;nbsp;co-authored;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a place to repost comments, reviews, and recommendations I wrote on other sites (like Quora, Amazon,&amp;nbsp;etc);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a place where my half-baked ideas and philosophizings go if I think them interesting enough for general&amp;nbsp;consumption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last one is what gives me trouble. Ideally, if I think a
topic is worth writing about, I should make the extra 3-day
effort to gather references, edit it nicely, and have it
published. But like the character in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_Drina"&gt;&amp;#8220;The bridge on the
Drina&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; who
&lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; to be the town chronicler but can never find an event worthy
enough to write about, most subjects have me less excited the more I
think about them. By the time I finish a blog post, then, I have no
intention to revisit the&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent filter against appearing foolish in print, but horrible for&amp;nbsp;productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two solutions come to mind readily, with equal chances of failing—either stop posting the third category of articles altogether and start writing everything with an intention of publishing; or start writing even more with the hope that at least a small percentage of that will turn into something a journal would accept for&amp;nbsp;publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former is a set-up for procrastination, the latter—doing extra work in a hope to create material for even more work—oxymoronic . I will try both and see where I end&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2016 13:47:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-01-04:/eng/2016/01/04/why/</guid></item><item><title>Locked in</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2016/01/02/locked-in/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I haplessly expressed excitement about my task list manager of choice being updated&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Speaking of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/culturedcode"&gt;@culturedcode&lt;/a&gt;, looks like Things 3 is progressing nicely. Hope “more structure” is code for dependencies. &lt;a href="http://t.co/ctwycDyL1e"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ctwycDyL1e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Miloš Miljković (@Miljko) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Miljko/status/429958780886196224"&gt;February 2, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hasn&amp;#8217;t yet. Two iterations of iOS and an Apple Watch later, Things 3 is still
not available, and I am becoming increasingly annoyed. Inside my mind, two kinds
of costs—Ms. Sunken and Mr. Opportunity—are battling it&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. O has me thinking about time wasted on not being able to turn a next action
into a project; or having to make too many taps to edit anything in the iOS app.
And then I stress out even more contemplating all the features I don&amp;#8217;t even know
I&amp;#8217;m missing out on—not wanting to find out about those is why I not dare read
reviews of the&amp;nbsp;competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. S, meanwhile, is raising dread whenever I thinking about moving to Omnifocus, Taskpaper, or whatever the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTD&lt;/span&gt; app du jour is—knowing that I would be trading a set of known deficiencies for a potentially grater set of unfamiliar&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mister and missus are irrational beings—even though Things 3 remains
vaporware, there have been a few 2.x updates that iOS7-fied the experience—from
going flat to adding extensions and notification center widgets. All that
considered, I should not
spend so much time thinking about an&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, it is 6pm on January 2, 2016, and instead of writing about getting back to the lab, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; finishing the PhD thesis, or being a haughty gastro-tourist in unseasonably warm New Orleans, I am being much too first-worldly for my Balkano-Serbian&amp;nbsp;comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I will add to the pile of absurd reasons for why I dislike Cultured&amp;nbsp;Code.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2016 18:14:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2016-01-02:/eng/2016/01/02/locked-in/</guid></item><item><title>Sve se vraća</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2015/11/24/sve-se-vraca/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Brzo: koje su još uvek profitabilne izvozne industrije u&amp;nbsp;Srbiji?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;se brzo zaborave. A onda vam ljudi sa progrešnog kraja nišana koji ste prodali
u trideset i petom poslovnom poduhvatu stoleća zakucaju na&amp;nbsp;vrata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zatim pročitate &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/belgian-terror-brussels-on-lockdown"&gt;gde evropski teroristi nabavljaju oružje&lt;/a&gt;
(za nestrpljive: u Briselu), i &lt;a href="http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Ekonomija/288716/Srbija-najvise-oruzja-izvozi-u-SAD-Irak-Italiju-i-Belgiju"&gt;spisak najvećih uvoznika srpskih

&lt;p&gt;Ovo nije problem samo sadašnje vlasti—i prethodnici su se &lt;a href="http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/13/Ekonomija/659351/Izvoz+oružja%2C+ali+i+pameti.html"&gt;ponosili

&lt;p&gt;Zato mi je drago što se Srbija—i ljudi i državne strukture—prema
izbeglicama ophodi bolje nego komšije. Ali, nemojmo se pretvarati da je

transplants is well-known in circles that know what haploidentical
transplants are. When I saw that Hopkins transplanters used it as
single-agent prophylaxis in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HLA&lt;/span&gt;-matched related donor transplants, I was intrigued
enough to do a full literature review. This is the result, presented as
a slightly-too-long fellow lecture, all 100+ slides of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have a hard time remembering facts unless I know the history
behind them, the section about the works of Dr. George Santos is rather
long. It was also important to show that crude animal models can be
both helpful (in telling you that higher doses of cyclophosphamide work
better for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GVHD&lt;/span&gt; prophylaxis that lower) and misleading (in making you
think high-dose Cy is toxic to hematopoietic stem cells, thus changing your
clinical trial&amp;nbsp;design).&lt;/p&gt;

a &lt;a href="http://43folders.com"&gt;lifehack guru&lt;/a&gt;-cum-&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies"&gt;internet personality&lt;/a&gt;. If you
are in a medical field, there is no particular reason you would know&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They co-host &lt;a href="http://relay.fm/rd"&gt;a podcast&lt;/a&gt; that modestly has themselves as the
subject matter. It is one of the best new podcasts this year, second only to
&lt;a href="http://relay.fm/cortex"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGP&lt;/span&gt; Grey&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; (though with &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/roadwork"&gt;Road Work&lt;/a&gt; coming out this week,
it may be a three-way tie). In this week&amp;#8217;s episode, Siracusa had this to
say about programmers (&lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+EtBou_7cc/39:00"&gt;link to the audio here&lt;/a&gt;—it sounds better than it&amp;nbsp;reads):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people can espouse information telling some younger programmer
&amp;#8220;make sure you always call &amp;#8216;srand&amp;#8217; before you call &amp;#8216;rand&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;, and they can
easily tell you &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t listen to that guy, you should not call &amp;#8216;srand&amp;#8217; before you
call&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;rand&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither one of them really understands it, because they can&amp;#8217;t
explain it. If that young programmer is saying &amp;#8220;But why? But why? Why? How do these
things work together? Explain it to me.&amp;#8221; and they realize &amp;#8220;Oh, I can&amp;#8217;t explain
it. All I have is this…&amp;#8221;—it&amp;#8217;s not a cargo cult, but it&amp;#8217;s more like—&amp;#8221;I have this
practice that I&amp;#8217;ve learned through supposed bitter experience that if I didn&amp;#8217;t
do this one time and something didn&amp;#8217;t work, then I did do it, then it did work.&amp;#8221;
Very often in programming you can sort of learn that way where basically &amp;#8220;I
tried this one thing and it didn&amp;#8217;t work, or this bug happened, then (I did) this other
thing, and the bug was fixed&amp;#8221;, and come away from that with a rule, or
a heuristic, or something you think is an unwritten law without actually
understanding the&amp;nbsp;underlying…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remind you of anything? In medicine, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult"&gt;&amp;#8220;cargo cult&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; is exactly&lt;br&gt;
the term I would use. Programming&amp;#8217;s saving grace is that it is a finite
system created by humans, and—at least in theory—knowable. The human
body is as black a box as it ever was—the only difference between now
and the 1800s being a stronger&amp;nbsp;flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, programming clearly shares this with medicine: most of its practitioners
don&amp;#8217;t have a firm grasp of what they are doing, and don&amp;#8217;t understand the
underlying principles of their craft. Why, then, do we fool ourselves that &lt;em&gt;adding&lt;/em&gt;
programmers&amp;#8217; idiosyncracies to physicians&amp;#8217; by the way of electronic medical
records, clinical decision support systems, and ultimately &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;-run &lt;em&gt;e-doctors&lt;/em&gt;, will
somehow &amp;#8220;fix&amp;#8221; medicine instead of making it bad in a different&amp;nbsp;way?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 19:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2015-08-14:/eng/2015/08/14/programming-medicine/</guid></item><item><title>Lečenje u NIH-u</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2015/07/22/nih-lecenje/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Jedna od mnogih stvari po kojima se &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt; razlikuje od ostalih
zdravstvenih ustanova je da pacijenti ne plaćaju ništa. Zdravstveno
osiguranje nije potrebno, lekovi—od kojih mnogi koštaju $1.000 po
dozi—se samo pokupe u apoteci, a ako živite daleko od Betezde &lt;em&gt;platiće
vam&lt;/em&gt; (domaći) let, voz, gorivo. Do pre 10-15 godina plaćali su i hotele,
sada je tu samo dnevnica od&amp;nbsp;$50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meni najzanimljivije—ne leče samo državljane. Štaviše, na nekim
protokolima ima više legalnih i ilegalnih imigranata iz Centralne i
Južne Amerike nego Amerikanaca. Ko god se pojavi na pragu instituta i
ispunjava uslove za upis na studiju može da računa na američke poreske
obveznike. A niko neće oterati nekoga ko je veoma bolestan ali ne
ispunjava uslove, naročito ako standardnu terapiju ne može primiti kod&amp;nbsp;kuće.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zato svaki put kada čujem da se u Srbiji skuplja desetine i stotine
hiljada evra da bi se neko poslao na lečenje u Italiju, Rusiju,
ili Nemačku, pomislim na stvari koje se rade ovde i da li bi one
pomogle. Ima ih previše za nabrajanje, tako da je najbolje otići na
&lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/"&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;—sajt koji ima podatke
o svim aktivnim studijama koje finansira &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt;—i pogledati da li postoji
nešto što se &lt;em&gt;izvodi&lt;/em&gt; (ne samo finansira) ovde. Ono što sam video u
poslednjih godinu dana, bez nekog&amp;nbsp;reda:&lt;/p&gt;

bolesti koje sam video van Instituta, pošto vam u drugim akademskim centrima
u Americi računi stižu iako ste na&amp;nbsp;studiji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U većini slučajeva se nekome iz Srbije sa metastatskim rakom ne bi
isplatilo da prelazi okean kako bi primio eksperimentalnu terapiju čija se
efikasnost još istražuje. Ali, treba se raspitati—mogu da zamislim situaciju
u kojoj bi itekako&amp;nbsp;vredelo.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2015 06:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2015-07-22:/srb/2015/07/22/nih-lecenje/</guid></item><item><title>A yearly welcome</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2015/07/01/a-yearly-welcome/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;July 1st is when most &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; residency programs let their new interns loose
after a week of corporate compliance training and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACGME&lt;/span&gt;-mandated talks
about&amp;nbsp;burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thewinnower.com/papers/advice-for-physicians-in-training-40-tips-from-40-docs"&gt;If you are a medical student or a new intern, read&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/06/03/three-tech-tips-for-new-interns/"&gt;And this short post of mine still&amp;nbsp;applies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, remember that it is easy to become very cynical very quickly.
That is not the best of defense mechanisms, but it is better than substance
abuse, domestic violence, or suicidal ideation. So, if you &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; be
cynical, do it &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; the chain of command, not down or laterally. That
way you will avoid preconditioning medical students, observers, and your
fellow interns. The senior residents will either support you in your
jadedness, or will get to feel smug when they tell you that you are too
young for that much cynicism. Your attendings should, ideally, teach you
why you are wrong—though the younger they are the more likely it is they
will behave like senior residents. So it&amp;#8217;s a win for everyone, really, unless
someone dings you for lack of&amp;nbsp;professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, please remember to&amp;nbsp;eat.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 07:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2015-07-01:/eng/2015/07/01/a-yearly-welcome/</guid></item><item><title>The overhead</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2015/05/29/the-overhead/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There are many misnomers in American medical English. Patients walk into
your &lt;em&gt;clinic&lt;/em&gt; (from Greek &lt;em&gt;kline&lt;/em&gt;, bed) to learn whether their scan was
&lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; (good) or &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; (bad). Those who have severe chronic
pain may ask for their &lt;em&gt;pain medicine&lt;/em&gt; (that relieve pain, not cause
it), usually opioids. Some physicians would call them &lt;em&gt;pain-seeking&lt;/em&gt;
(though what they are seeking is relief). If they don&amp;#8217;t get a prescription,
they may rate their doctor poorly on a patient satisfaction survey,
which is a big thing if you are into &lt;em&gt;quality improvement&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Quality&lt;/em&gt;
improvement. There&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quality improvement&lt;/em&gt; in medicine is &lt;a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/quality/toolbox/methodology/qualityimprovement/index.html"&gt;by definition&lt;/a&gt;
limited to improving things you can measure, i.e. quantify, i.e. judge
by criteria that are the &lt;em&gt;ying&lt;/em&gt; to quality&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;yang&lt;/em&gt;. Those measures may
be valid or not, and may improve patients&amp;#8217; lives, longevity, etc. (or
not) but they are not quality. Because they are measures. Numbers. You
know,&amp;nbsp;quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement is dangerous in at least three ways. Firstly and most
obviously, many of the things being measured haven&amp;#8217;t been validated
in prospective trials. They are either (poor) conjecture—like tight
glycemic control for type &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; diabetics assumed to help because of good
outcomes in type ones (since, you know, a skinny teenager and a morbidly
obese 60-year-old are similar that way.) Or they came out of a corporate
think-tank cocaine-fueled outside-the-box brainstorming session, like
patient satisfaction scores&lt;sup id="fnref:pg"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pg" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, even if they were the best measures in the world, tying them
to promotion and compensation would have the unintended consequence
of having practitioners loose sight of all other aspects of medicine,
including the patient. There are many accounts of how it can
happen—&lt;a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/8134"&gt;this one from Dr. Centor comes readily to mind&lt;/a&gt;—but
since (1) identifying and (2) addressing the patient&amp;#8217;s actual problem is
difficult to measure objectively, it is not one of the&amp;nbsp;benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, wherever there are numbers and money, techniques will
evolve to game the system. &lt;a href="http://davidsimon.com/the-bad-math/"&gt;David Simon&amp;#8217;s account of how this happens
in law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; is applicable. Want fewer central line
infections? Enact a policy not to draw blood cultures from central
lines! Too many nosocomial urinary tract infections? Urinalyses on
admission for everyone! Hospitals create teams with dozens of people
whose only job is to find new and better ways to do this. And they have
to—because everyone else is doing it. A depressing amount of time,
money, and effort wasted because of pointless exercises of anonymous&amp;nbsp;pencil-pushers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how you get to &lt;a href="http://thedoctorweighsin.com/the-rise-of-the-machine-how-hospitalpractice-admins-have-assumed-control/"&gt;a near 3000% increase in the number of hospital
administrators over 30 years&lt;/a&gt;. I am sure they are all good
people, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/sunday-review/doctors-salaries-are-not-the-big-cost.html"&gt;with good salaries&lt;/a&gt;, but they are, for the most part,
insignificant. An epiphenomenon induced by someone&amp;#8217;s desire to turn
healthcare into an industry, forgetting that the six sigma ideology that
works so well for toaster ovens can&amp;#8217;t be forced onto moist, squishy, and
fragile&amp;nbsp;humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is also a good working definition of quality&amp;nbsp;improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:pg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some speculation on my end there. They might have been on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSD&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:pg" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;miljokaz&lt;/em&gt;—moje dalje usavršavanje neće zavisiti od dobre volje srpske&amp;nbsp;birokratije.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranci koji žele specijalizaciju u Americi a nemaju zelenu kartu mogu
birati između dve vrste lanaca—&lt;span class="caps"&gt;H1B&lt;/span&gt; i J1 vize. Ova prva je radna viza,
skuplja, i većina akademskih programa je ne sponzoriše. J1 je poznata
studentima iz Srbije koji dolaze u &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAD&lt;/span&gt; preko &lt;em&gt;work and travel&lt;/em&gt; programa.
Postoji posebna verzija J1 vize za lekare, koja je zasnovana na sledećim&amp;nbsp;pretpostavkama:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;u zemlji iz koje dolazite postoji potreba za lekarima određene specijalizacije,&amp;nbsp;ali&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ne postoje kapaciteti za školovanje tih specijalista, tako&amp;nbsp;da&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strana zemlja šalje lekara u Ameriku,&amp;nbsp;ali&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pod uslovom da se nakon završetka specijalizacije vrati u svoju zemlju na bar dve&amp;nbsp;godine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ako neko želi da ostane u Americi nakon završetka specijalizacije, to
može&amp;nbsp;uraditi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nakon što provede bar dve godine u matičnoj zemlji,&amp;nbsp;ili&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tako što radi dve do pet godina u delu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAD&lt;/span&gt; sa manjkom lekara te&amp;nbsp;specijalnosti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prve četiri stavke su vrhunsko licimerje sa američke strane, jer su
baš njima potrebni lekari generalno, a naročito specijalizanti. Broj
medicinskih fakulteta je decenijama bio ograničem zbog straha lekarskog
lobija da će hiperprodukcijom doći do pojeftinjenja radne snage
(khm&lt;em&gt;Srbija&lt;/em&gt;khm). Iz moje perspektive—hvala&amp;nbsp;im.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na žalost, to znači da od države morate dobiti potvrdu da je sve
gore navedeno tačno. Za Srbiju, ovo je čist kabuki. Ako i postoji
potreba za nekom specijalnošću, nema se para za plaćanje svršenog
specijaliste—naročito ako vam veći deo posla obavljaju volonteri. A
svakako vam niko ne može reći kakva će biti situacija nakon četiri-pet
godina (da li se u Srbiji bilo šta može planirati na tako dugi&amp;nbsp;rok?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procedura je haotična. Najbolje se može uporediti sa umrtvljivanjem
zubnog živca pri kojem vam zubar ne kaže koliko će zuba stradati. I ne
koristi anesteziju. A zubarska stolica je istovremeno i električna, sa
satom koji&amp;nbsp;otkucava.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karakterišu je četiri&amp;nbsp;momenta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;službenici i službenice koji ne znaju o čemu se&amp;nbsp;radi;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;osoba do koje dođete nakon tridesetog telefonskog poziva zna šta vam treba, ali ne sme
  to da napiše jer ne može da vam garantuje posao (iako nigde u potvrdi ne treba da
  stoji bilo šta o garantovanom zaposlenju); kada božanskom intervencijom ipak
  sastavi&amp;nbsp;potvrdu,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;osoba koja treba da je &lt;em&gt;potpiše&lt;/em&gt; ne može to da uradi jer je na odmoru,
  službenom putu, operacionoj sali, ili lebdi iznad Sahare u balonu, izgubljena i
  bez&amp;nbsp;kompasa;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vaš budući poslodavac, koji vam svake nedelje šalje podsetnik da ističe vreme
  za dobijanje&amp;nbsp;vize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakon uljudnih molbi, svakodnevnih telefonskih poziva, preklinjanja na kolenima,
i pretnjama zaštitnikom za ljudska prava i—ključni momenat—medijima, izaćićete
iz zgrade u Nemanjinoj isceđeni kao krpa, ali sa dovoljno snage da otrčitite do
Fedeksa kako biste to parče papira poslali kome treba u 26 milisekunde do&amp;nbsp;dvanaest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nije tako svakome i svaki put, ali se desilo dovoljno puta meni i ljudima koje
znam da je malo verovatno da je u pitanju nečija loša&amp;nbsp;sreća.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tema za razmišljanje: zašto Ministarstvo zdravlja ne bi pojednostavilo
i ubrzalo proceduru, ali i počelo da naplaćuje taksu od ljudi koji su
se (uglavnom) besplatno školovali, a sada idu negde gde će u bliskoj
budućnosti imati za srpske uslove više nego pristojna primanja? Indija,
najveći svetski izvoznik lekara, pre izdavanje potvrde traži od budućih
specijalizanata koji su završili državnu školu da potpišu obavezu da će,
ukoliko se ne vrate kući nakon specijalizacije, platiti oko $5.000 u&amp;nbsp;rupijima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naravno, lako mi je to da predložim kada mi potvrda više ne treba. Ali mi
je neverovatno da je srpskoj birokratiji lakše da izvodi gore opisane
burleske nego da radi svoj posao i pošteno zaradi pare; i da se država
Srbija bez ikakve nadoknade odriče intelektualnog kapitala u koji je
prethodno uložila&amp;nbsp;finansijski.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2015 06:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2015-05-19:/srb/2015/05/19/zbogom-nemanjino/</guid></item><item><title>Talk therapy</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2015/05/07/talk-therapy/</link><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;She makes the mistake of talking to&amp;nbsp;patients.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;cite&gt;Overheard from a fellow discussing the consult attending&amp;#8217;s rounding
habits&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there such a thing as spending too much time with a patient? The
question seems preposterous, when recent time motion studies showed
that physicians in general, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595927"&gt;and residents in particular&lt;/a&gt;, clock
embarrassingly few face-to-face minutes. The quote above was said with
a wink and a nudge, but there are situations when it can be true,
particularly if you talk &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; a patient—or &lt;em&gt;get talked to&lt;/em&gt;—instead of
having a&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two groups are at highest risk of talking too much—trainees and
consultants. Many an internist remembers having to pick up the pieces
after a consulting physician flew by the bedside to throw an unasked
for opinion bomb. Think hematologists talking about insulin regimens,
cardiologists about causes and treatment of back pain, or orthopedic
surgeons about code status. &amp;#8220;But one doctor said…&amp;#8221; and a perplexed look
is the usual outcome, more so if the consultant debated him or herself
out&amp;nbsp;loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellows are even more efficient sowers of confusion. Unlike some of
their superiors, they still remember other fields well enough to a) have
a valid opinion, and b) keep it to themselves. Where they are at highest
risk for foot-in-mouth is the area of their future expertise—picking up
just enough from the attendings to sound knowledgeable, yet not knowing
enough to tell the patient what they don&amp;#8217;t know. Even at later stages
of training, a fellow&amp;#8217;s best plan shared with the patient may tumble
down when the attending gives a diametrically opposed recommendation.
The common scenario is one in which there is no evidence, and clinical
judgment rules. You can either not share your own view, or punctuate
every conversation with &amp;#8220;But we&amp;#8217;ll see what my attending says.&amp;#8221; More
time wasted, and for&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients themselves can be talkative, sometimes to their detriment.
The reasons are many, and understandable: they have much to say about
themselves—relevant to why they are in the hospital and not so much,
they might not have anyone at home listening, they may have some level
of delirium, dementia, or other cognitive disorder. Being able to
identify such a person, and then knowing how to direct the conversation,
is an unknown skill for most trainees and goes against today&amp;#8217;s dogma
of giving patients time to talk. No harm done to the chatty ones, but
there are only so many hours in the day, and some of them should be
spent&amp;nbsp;thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we don&amp;#8217;t have an epidemic of young doctors staying in the
hospital until 2am while demented World War &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; veterans regail them with
half-made up stories from Normandy. If only. But more isn&amp;#8217;t always
better, and physicians need to know when to speak up (to get their patient
back on the topic), and when to stay quiet (not to overwhelm them with
half-baked&amp;nbsp;ideas).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2015 10:06:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2015-05-07:/eng/2015/05/07/talk-therapy/</guid></item><item><title>Vanredno stanje</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2015/04/28/vanredno-stanje/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Moj frizer, Amerikanac grčkog porekla, je nakon očeve smrti proveo mesec
dana u Atini da bi prodao stan—neplanirano, pošto nije znao da je Grčka
zatvorena u avgustu. Para imao nije, pa je vreme provodio gledajući
grčku televiziju (&amp;#8220;6 glava preko celog ekrana, viču jedna na drugu&amp;#8221;) i
razgovarajući sa ujakom i njegovim prijateljima, uglavnom o prljavim,
pokvarenim, lenjim&amp;nbsp;Albancima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utisak: ljudi su svuda isti. Svako ima svoje crnce i Meksikance, i svoj
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juče su grupe siromašne omladine sa viškom vremena i manjkom
ciljeva—možda a možda i ne podstaknute vrhom baltimorske sive i crne
ekonomije—lomile, palile, i krale po svom gradu. Policija je bacala
suzavac, omladina je bacala cigle. &lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-viewing-20150426-story.html"&gt;Razlog za demonstracije&lt;/a&gt;
brzo su zaboravili i demonstranti, i policija, &lt;a href="http://mic.com/articles/116524/outrage-over-baltimore-riots-completely-misses-the-point"&gt;a pre svih
novinari&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da nisam na odmoru, bio bih iznerviran jer je deo grada kojim svakog
jutra idem na posao bio u haosu. Kao što je 23-ojka koja me je vozila od
Karaburme do Instituta za histologiju stajala dok su palili ambasade u
Kneza&amp;nbsp;Miloša.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ljudi su svuda isti, osim kad&amp;nbsp;nisu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naša zalutala omladina voli da pali, lomi, i pljačka centar grada.
Baltimorska uništava sopstveni, već propali komšiluk. Naša se nominalno
bori za Kosovo (ili, izgleda, za istrebljenje suparničkog tima),
baltimorska protiv policijske brutalnosti. Situacija u Baltimoru je
jasna: narko preduzetnici sa jedne strane, policija sa druge, siromašni
crnci kao pijuni u sredini. Ko se drži po strani popije zalutali metak, suzavac,
lom vratnog pršljena. U Srbiji se teže razaznaje ko koga napada,
podržava, podstiče, i brani. Ne znam šta je bolje, i ne znam za&amp;nbsp;koga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretpostaviću da ste kao svaki dobar akademski građanin odgledali &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire"&gt;The
Wire&lt;/a&gt;. Dejvid Sajmon je &lt;a href="http://davidsimon.com/"&gt;na svom blogu&lt;/a&gt; već ranije pisao
kako je čudo što do bacanja cigli nije došlo ranije, i u većoj meri.
Neki su u komentarima to protumačili kao podrška jučerašnjim protestima.
U &lt;a href="http://davidsimon.com/baltimore/"&gt;svom poslednjem tekstu&lt;/a&gt; je zamolio ljude da prestanu sa
paljenjem, i da se vrate kući. Neki drugi su u tome videli bogatog belca
koji crncima naređuje da&amp;nbsp;ćute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sviđa mi se kako Sajmon razmišlja, a i napravio je odličnu seriju,
pa ću reći da je u pravu čim ga napadaju obe strane. To nije neki
argument, ali i pored skoro pet godina provedenih u Baltimoru, bolji
nemam—razmišljao sam o drugim stvarima. Ako vas interesuju rasne borbe

You don&amp;#8217;t need to have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; to get it; if it is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;-associated it doesn&amp;#8217;t always disappear with antiretroviral therapy; and if it does it may come back years later. Even oncologists in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; don&amp;#8217;t see it often, let alone podiatrists—hence some bizare treatment recommendations in the slides&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 06:49:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2015-04-25:/eng/2015/04/25/kaposis-not-your-every-day-sarcoma/</guid></item><item><title>The pitfalls of ultrasubspecialization</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2015/04/11/ultrasubspecialization/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t yet seen &lt;a href="http://cancerfilms.org/"&gt;the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PBS&lt;/span&gt; documentary on Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, do it as
soon as possible. A free stream is available &lt;a href="http://video.pbs.org/program/story-cancer-emperor-all-maladies/"&gt;on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PBS&lt;/span&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;
but it is well worth the $15 on&amp;nbsp;iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes many good points, one of which is the siliness of viewing
cancer in general, or of any particular organ, as being a single
entity. Genitourinary and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GYN&lt;/span&gt; malignancies are sill fresh in my
mind after this last rotation, so an example that comes first is
prostate cancer. Most have your standard testosterone-dependent, androgen
deprivation therapy-sensitive cells. Once they stop responding to
hormonal therapy, treatment is still targeted towards the (now mutated)
androgen receptor. Small cell prostate cancer, however, looks and
behaves differently—tending to be bulkier, more aggressive, and having
earlier visceral organ metastases. Ultimately, we treat it more like its
namesake in the lung, with cisplatin and&amp;nbsp;etoposide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was an easy distinction to make, since small cell prostate cancer
looks nothing like adenocarcinoma under a microscope. Not so for
breast cancer. We now know that it is at least four diseases which are
at first glance all the same: luminal A (hormone receptor-positive,
Her2-negaitve); luminal B (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HR&lt;/span&gt;-positive, Her2-positive); &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HR&lt;/span&gt;-negative,
Her2-positive; and triple-negative (also called basal-like, though
definitions of basal-like breast cancer vary). The first three, which
we are now able to distinguish with immunohistochemistry and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FISH&lt;/span&gt;,
have different behaviour, treatment, and prognosis. The fourth is
a catch-all category that probably contains many different diseases we
don&amp;#8217;t know about yet. Some of those triple-negatives may have more in
common with colon or lung cancer than they do with other malignancies of
the&amp;nbsp;breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which organ the cancer is in should be important to a surgeon or a
radiation oncologist, who have to deal with the anatomy. But should
medical oncologists subspecialize by organ, or by cell? Why is a
neuro-oncologist better suited to treat primary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNS&lt;/span&gt; lymphoma than
a hematologist whose main interest are aggresive lymphomas? Does a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GI&lt;/span&gt; oncologist have a better skillset and knowledge base for dealing
with neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas than an oncologist who
deals with endocrine gland malignancies? Are there other, not so obvious
connections between different cancers that we are missing because of&amp;nbsp;ultrasubspecialization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know enough oncology to answer any of these questions, but they
are interesting questions to&amp;nbsp;make.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2015 10:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2015-04-11:/eng/2015/04/11/ultrasubspecialization/</guid></item><item><title>Male breast cancer: designing a trial</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2015/03/24/male-breast-cancer-designing-a-trial/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after [posting my latest tumor board presentation][cmc8], I discovered that someone is making a documentary about men with breast cancer.

&lt;p&gt;Now they are &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id806809930?at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;coming for the doctors&lt;/a&gt; (see What&amp;#8217;s New in Version 3.0.5).
The makers of MedCalc, the best medical calculator app out there, &lt;a href="http://medcalc.medserver.be/dosegate.html"&gt;explained
what happend&lt;/a&gt; in detail&lt;sup id="fnref:dosegate"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dosegate" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This was the rule they were
supposedly&amp;nbsp;infringing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22.9&lt;/strong&gt; Apps that calculate medicinal dosages must be submitted by the
manufacturer of those medications or recognized institutions such as
hospitals, insurance companies, and&amp;nbsp;universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevermind that many doctors view themselves as institutions—this is
an idiotic rule. Is University of Baltimore, which has no biomedical
science courses or programs, allowed to publish a drug dose calculator?
Is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEICO&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDA&lt;/span&gt; has issued &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM263366.pdf"&gt;guidance for mobile medical apps&lt;/a&gt;. It
specificaly allows calculators that use generally available formulas,
and forbids apps which calculate &lt;em&gt;radiation&lt;/em&gt; dosage, but does not
mention drugs. Where, then, did this rule come&amp;nbsp;from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, the same App store rules that allowed &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homeopathy-cures/id479869465?mt=8"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homeopathy-materia-medica/id623045549?mt=8"&gt;pearls&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kent-homeopathic-repertory/id681045237?mt=8"&gt;quackery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s madness, and it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;maddening.&lt;/p&gt;

what I had learned, a single post may not be enough for breast
cancer. Six weeks ago, I knew that it was &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/probability-breast-cancer"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt;, maybe
&lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening/breast/HealthProfessional/page8#_423_toc"&gt;overdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, possibly &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.28260/full"&gt;overtreated&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-funding"&gt;beating all other cancers for research funding by a vast
margin&lt;/a&gt;. All this was a vague sense of being informed—like a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt; reader may feel after reading the Sunday Magazine feature—rather than
actual&amp;nbsp;knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having talked to a good number of women with breast cancer, and
worked with a few attendings dedicated to the field, I know it
enough to know that I need to know more; but also enough to
keep me interested. What from the outside looks like cookbook
&lt;em&gt;this-marker-means-she&amp;#8217;s-getting-that-treatment&lt;/em&gt; medicine is in fact an
intricate work of knowing your patient, figuring out where she stands in
the heaps of data generated by decades-long studies following thousands
of women on different protocols, discussing the options, and coming to a
mutualy agreed decision&lt;sup id="fnref:preposterous"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:preposterous" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Hard work, all of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harder still is working on those data-generating trials. Anyone can
think of a clinicaly relevant question, but can they make it into a
feasable protocol? Can they gather a team to manage all the patients in
the center, and all the different centers? Can they manage that team?
&lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-funding"&gt;Looking at a recent set of trials you will hear more about soon&lt;/a&gt;,
the scale boggles the&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: &amp;#8220;We don&amp;#8217;t have a crystal ball&amp;#8221; is common oncspeak for &amp;#8220;I
don&amp;#8217;t know what your prognosis is&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref:badprog"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:badprog" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but if a person has breast
cancer what are &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/"&gt;the Gail model&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.oncotypedx.com/"&gt;Oncotype &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if not
(developing, imperfect) tellers of fortune? And wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be great to
have a similar set of tools and statistics for all&amp;nbsp;cancers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, not going into the field, but thoroughly&amp;nbsp;impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:preposterous"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is—truth be told—what we should do for any cancer, or
illness. Alas, most diseases lack data, options, or both.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:preposterous" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:badprog"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in the paternalistic dialect of the language, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want to tell you that you prognosis is poor&amp;#8221;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:badprog" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Christmas, New Year&amp;#8217;s, and everyone being away for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASH&lt;/span&gt;, it was a joke.
The only memorable part were the first two weeks—the oncology consults
at Georgetown—which reminded me that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt; was indeed an ivory
tower. This is compared to a well-known academic center. Compared to
a community hospital—&lt;a href="http://www.lifebridgehealth.org/Sinai/Sinai1.aspx?cpsys_redirect=404"&gt;my last employer being a good example&lt;/a&gt;,
though you may find &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Stroger,_Jr._Hospital_of_Cook_County"&gt;much better&lt;/a&gt;—the Institutes in general and
the Clinical Center in particular are a tower of crystalized angel
tears sitting high on top of a mountain range on Mars. This is neither
criticism nor praise, but a statement of fact&lt;sup id="fnref:tears"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tears" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having only spent four days on Georgetown consult service, I would
rather not comment&lt;sup id="fnref:bad"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bad" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But here are ten things about the inpatient
side of my home institution that might interest the outside&amp;nbsp;world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is only one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMR&lt;/span&gt; and no paper&amp;nbsp;charts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone else, most commonly the research nurse, will obtain the outside
  records and have them scanned in—so the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMR&lt;/span&gt; is the only place you need to look
  for&amp;nbsp;anything;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are usually no medical students, interns, or residents—it&amp;#8217;s the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PA&lt;/span&gt;,
  fellow, and the attending running the&amp;nbsp;show;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the 3am page from the nurse asking for a Tylenol order? If it is for
  someone on a phase 1 trial, you&amp;#8217;d better check the protocol and call the
  attending before giving&amp;nbsp;it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients can be &amp;#8220;out on pass&amp;#8221;—meaning they can leave the campus for up to
  20-something days and still count as an inpatient, without needing to be
  discharged and&amp;nbsp;readmitted;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a patient needs to stay an extra day or two because of transport issues, 
  nobody blinks an&amp;nbsp;eye;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For three to to five days you will get weird looks if it is your patient, but
  there will be no passive-aggresive emails about the hospital not getting&amp;nbsp;reimbursement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it is six days or more it is likely they are homeless—social work will be on&amp;nbsp;it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordering most imaging—ultrasounds, CTs, MRIs, etc—requires two steps: getting
  a time-slot from central scheduling, or the tech on call if it is a same-day
  scan, and putting in the order. Think about the implications and let it sink&amp;nbsp;in;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All discharge medications are dispensed from the outpatient pharmacy free of
  charge to the patient. Yes, all of&amp;nbsp;them;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people treated at the Clinical Center are trial participants who
are sick, rather than &amp;#8220;just&amp;#8221; patients. There are no administrative or financial
pressures, no dealings with insurance companies, and not much concern with
disposition. As you can imagine, this makes for a beautiful work&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bad"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes it sound worse than it was. I don&amp;#8217;t want to comment
because n=4, not because I&amp;#8217;m holding back the criticism.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bad" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:tears"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angel tears are a pain to clean up when they melt.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:tears" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an online resource for learning statistics needed for clinicians
explained in a language that could be understood by&amp;nbsp;doctors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many biostatistics courses available on
&lt;a href="http://coursera.org"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;. Living in Baltimore,
I&amp;#8217;m biased towards &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JHU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s offerings. &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/casebasedbiostat"&gt;&amp;#8220;Case-Based Introduction to
Biostatistics&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. Scott
Zeger is a good one. If you prefer text to video, here are three
good&amp;nbsp;resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An article: &lt;a href="http://images.cell.com/images/EdImages/etbr/DUKES.PDF"&gt;&amp;#8220;A Review of Basic
Biostatistics&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;
by Kimberly Dukes and Lisa Sullivan (free &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A short book: &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/science-art-medicine/id643948555?mt=11"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Science of the Art of
Medicine&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. John Brush (free, iBooks&amp;nbsp;only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A textbook: &lt;a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/statistical-inference-for-everyone-sie.html"&gt;&amp;#8220;Statistical Inference for
Everyone&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; by Brian Blais (also&amp;nbsp;free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick one, it would be Dr. Brush&amp;#8217;s book. He is a cardiologist
writing for other physicians in a language they can understand. Also,
&lt;a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/category/richard-lehmans-weekly-review-of-medical-journals/"&gt;Dr.

meaningfuly contribute&lt;/a&gt;. Thought you might like to see my&amp;nbsp;answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why would someone choose to be a chief resident (in internal&amp;nbsp;medicine)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cynical answers would be &amp;#8220;out of a misguided sense of loyalty to
your program&amp;#8221;. The correct and not very useful answer is—it&amp;nbsp;depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most positions entail primarily administrative responsibilities, with
some teaching and clinical duties, and a salary just slightly higher
than that of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGY&lt;/span&gt;-3. So, you can expect your patient care skills to
languish unless you work on maintaining them, your teaching skills to
be slightly improved—or at least no worse if you&amp;#8217;ve had some prior
experience—and your knowledge of hospital administration, people
management, dealing with email, and making the most out of seemingly
pointless meetings to go through the roof. If you have any interest in
academic medicine, as a generalist and sub-specialist alike, this last
skill set will be invaluable. It is also a stamp of approval of sorts
for any fellowship program director looking at your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CV&lt;/span&gt; if and when you&amp;nbsp;apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also have much more free time. Depending on how many chiefs your
program has, it will be most or all weekends, and almost all federal
holidays. This is a good time to study for the boards if you haven&amp;#8217;t
taken them already, write up the research you&amp;#8217;ve been working on, or
spend some time with your family (the chief&amp;#8217;s maternity/paternity leave
is usually more flexible, but that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;program-dependent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downsides: you will have one fewer year of attending-level salary,
so if you have a large debt or other financial responsibilities think
twice before saying yes; some friendships you made with the junior
residents will be undone or temporarily put on hold, unless you are
&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; careful about not playing favorites; you may lose some respect
for your higher-ups, as it goes whenever you peek behind the curtain;
you will need to develop a thick skin, if you don&amp;#8217;t have one already.
Some would say these last two are actually pluses. It&amp;nbsp;depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa issues complicate the matter, but I won&amp;#8217;t go into
details—bureaucracy shouldn&amp;#8217;t play a role in determining a career
choice, and when there is will (your own as well as the program&amp;#8217;s) there
is a way to bypass any&amp;nbsp;obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this&amp;nbsp;helps.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2014 11:54:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-12-20:/eng/2014/12/20/why-be-a-chief-resident/</guid></item><item><title>A few good pens</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/12/17/a-few-good-pens/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Helping out Georgetown University fellows with their oncology consult
service for a few days reminded me of how important it was to have at
least three good pens with you at all times. By that, I don&amp;#8217;t mean
grabbing a handful of disposable Bics from a Staples shelf just because
you know you will lose a lot—though you should certainly plan for
theft and absent-mindedness. There are at least three different use
cases you will face daily, and no pen will be ideal for all of them.
I&amp;#8217;ve tried out enough, &lt;a href="http://www.relay.fm/penaddict"&gt;and listened to plenty of podcasts on the
topic&lt;/a&gt;, to be happy with my&amp;nbsp;choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Role 1: The task&amp;nbsp;keeper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My choice: &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Push-Clip-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.4-mm-Black/pd/797"&gt;Zebra Sarasa Push Clip Gel Ink Pen, 0.4 mm&amp;nbsp;black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First runner-up: &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Standard-Ballpoint-Pen-0.5-mm-Blue-Ink-White-Body/pd/3233"&gt;Uni Jetstream Standard Ballpoint Pen, 0.5 mm&amp;nbsp;black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honorable mention: &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-3-Color-Gel-Ink-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Black-Body/pd/2602"&gt;Zebra Sarasa 3 Color Gel Ink Multi Pen, 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intern or fellow, this will be your most-used pen—the one you pull out
to quickly jot and check off to-dos, make note of pertinent lab values
and vital signs, and write down other important bits of information. If
you are anything like me or my colleagues, you will be doing this on the
signout, or some other piece of paper packed with information you might&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why your pen should&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as thin as possible, since you&amp;#8217;ll likely write on the margins,&amp;nbsp;but&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;not too faint, so it wouldn&amp;#8217;t blend in with the rest of the&amp;nbsp;text,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quick to use, since you&amp;#8217;ll have to pull it out during rounds, patient
  encounters, and other situations in which fiddling with the cap would lead to
  losing both time and the cap,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;affordable, since you will misplace one every couple of&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first two, the Uni Jetstream wins hands-down. The tip is as smooth
as a 0.5 mm can be. It doesn&amp;#8217;t skip, spill, sploch, or splat. The price
is right—just $2.99 on jetpens.com. It is the best-in-class for every
thing save&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zebra Sarasa Push Clip is not too thin, but thin enough to be scratchy
and slightly annoying. Even with that small flaw, I choose it before the
Jetstream. Because of the clip. The wonderful, magical&amp;nbsp;clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, after four years of rounding, the act of pulling out a pen becomes
a reflex. You hear something important, you have a thought, you blink, and you
have a pen in one hand and your Very Important Paper in the other. You write
something down, you blink, and your hands are free again. You are one with the
sign out, and the&amp;nbsp;pen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, you must at all times know where those two things are. The
Very Important Paper is hard to miss, but the pen needs to be not just
in the same pocket, but &lt;em&gt;in the same spot in your pocket&lt;/em&gt; at all times.
For me, the whitecoat-less fellow, that&amp;#8217;s the inside of my left front
pants pocket. This requirement rules out any clipless pens—goodbye, disposable
Bics—but the regular clips don&amp;#8217;t fare too well either. Too tight a clip, and you
spend too much time fiddling it into the spot you want. Too loose, and it&amp;#8217;s easy
to put in, and easy to&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why the clip is magical. You open it wide on entrance, and clamp it
shut once you have the pen where you want it. It won&amp;#8217;t budge after hours of
walking up and down the hospital stairs. And, unlike one of my Jetstreams, it
will be very difficult to&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, it only comes in one color. This is enough for the mild-to-moderate
inpatient workload of a fellow, but during internship I needed &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JFR8Q8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002JFR8Q8&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20&amp;amp;linkId=J323ILMTAPBLCF2E"&gt;the typical
gunner pen&lt;/a&gt; to stay organized. Zebra Sarasa 3 is the high-end guner
pen—one color fewer, but with the Zebra clip. For me today, it is just too
bulky, I default to black anyway, and I&amp;#8217;d just get annoyed with it running out
way before the other two. But for me four year ago, it would have been&amp;nbsp;perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Role 2: The note&amp;nbsp;writer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice: &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Petit1-Mini-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib-Blue-Black/pd/8609"&gt;Ohto Graphic Liner Needle Point Drawing Pen - 02, 0.5 mm black&lt;/a&gt;
Runner-up: &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Petit1-Mini-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib-Blue-Black/pd/8609"&gt;Pilot Petit1 Mini Fountain Pen - Fine Nib, any&amp;nbsp;colour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I appreciate the ammount of writing I can cram onto a sign
out with a thin pen, using one to write in paper charts, or for making
notes on an old H&amp;amp;P while seeing a patient, creates an unreadable mess. The faint
black lines of your pen blend in with the small type and the gray ruled lines of
the progress note. Also, you don&amp;#8217;t need as quick an access—a morning
note-writing session may seem hectic, but you are the one who initiates the
process. A couple of seconds looking for the pen or opening the cap won&amp;#8217;t make
you lose any&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohto liner leaves a consistent, dark line, lasts for ages, and is the right
size for me. The ink is water-proof and archival safe—which is what you want for
a medico-legal document. There&amp;#8217;s a cap you need to worry about, but I&amp;#8217;ve yet to
lose one. And at $2.50 it won&amp;#8217;t be the end of the world if I&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role can also be filled by a nice fountain pen—and you&amp;#8217;ll see some
attendings using one. I have had horrible luck finding a fountain pen
that I won&amp;#8217;t be afraid spilling in my bag or pocket, and most cost too
much to carry around the hospital while sleep-deprived. The Pilot Petit1
pens have the right price, nice nib, and are easy enough to use. But I&amp;#8217;m
still too scared to put it in my&amp;nbsp;pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Role 3: The&amp;nbsp;backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXWGWE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003FXWGWE&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20&amp;amp;linkId=IOMW5AIFSOO3XGVF"&gt;Uni-ball Signo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UM&lt;/span&gt;-151 Gel Ink&amp;nbsp;Pen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the one you sprinkle around the house to be there just in case.
The one you give out to friends and colleagues. And the one you use if
you lose any of the others. If you needed to have just one pen, this
would be the one, since it&amp;#8217;s both thin and dark. Not perfect for either
notes or task lists, but good&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At slightly less than $2 per pen it is afordable enough, though if you
just want something to give out to others—and don&amp;#8217;t care about them or
their fingers—you can get a box of 60 horrible little stick for the
price of three Signos. I guess you can give those out to your enemies
and watch them writhe in pain and&amp;nbsp;frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: A pencil&amp;nbsp;case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice: &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Will-Stationery-Actic-Mini-Pencil-Case-Black/pd/4352"&gt;Kokuyo Will Stationery Actic Mini Pencil&amp;nbsp;Case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is entirely optional, but it saved me a surprising amount of time. It
comfortably fits 4-5 pens and refills, and has good build quality. If your bag
is small or you don&amp;#8217;t mind fishing around for the pen you want, you can
certainly do without&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2014 12:55:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-12-17:/eng/2014/12/17/a-few-good-pens/</guid></item><item><title>How to say “I don’t know” like an intern</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/12/11/i-dont-know-phrases/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A key skill to have during oral exams back in med school was never
to admit not knowing. Avoid the areas you&amp;#8217;re uncertain of, dodge the
examiner&amp;#8217;s field of expertise as much as you can, and never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;
say &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sage words were passed on from generation to generation,
propagated by everyone, including me. Only, this wasn&amp;#8217;t what I or
any of my friends actually thought. It was a poke at the climate of
intellectual dishonesty at our school, not a guide to success in&amp;nbsp;medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting residency, though, flips the sarcasm switch somewhere and
the funny guidelines become instructions to be followed verbatim. The
knowledge in question is different—patient data instead of textbook
medicine—but the idea is the same. Observe the modern American intern&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;vocabulary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not that I know of&lt;/em&gt; (means &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t aware of that&lt;/em&gt; (means &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t know&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think it is&lt;/em&gt; (means &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if it is&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I belive so&lt;/em&gt; (means &lt;em&gt;I have no idea, but yeah, maybe&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It probably was&lt;/em&gt; (means &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have a clue but I did a D6 roll in my head
  and it was a 5&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used all of the above, and more, during internship, but still
get frustrated hearing it from others&lt;sup id="fnref:liar"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:liar" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If you are an intern, or anyone
reporting patient data to a person above you in the pecking order, try using &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I
don&amp;#8217;t know, but I can find out in a second&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; instead. Then start practicing your
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMR&lt;/span&gt; skills to trully make it a&amp;nbsp;second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:liar"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes me a liar and a hippocrite, yes, but at least I&amp;#8217;m
being honest about it.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:liar" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

involves taking a 6am train and not getting back home until 7. Combined
inpatient/outpatient juggling twice a week didn&amp;#8217;t help either, and
neither did the high turnover&lt;sup id="fnref:dictate"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dictate" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Still, as inpatient rotations
go, this one was reasonably busy—enough for me to learn quite a bit, but
never overwhelming. More importantly, the attendings &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/11/01/t-cellhistiocyte-rich-large-b-cell-lymphoma/"&gt;were awesome, the
cases interesting&lt;/a&gt;, co-workers friendly,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the slide set I&amp;#8217;ve linked to above shows, lymphoma are tricky in
that many are either curable or indolent enough to be kept at bay
until something else gets to the patient; but when it&amp;#8217;s bad—and with
current technology we can&amp;#8217;t with certainty say which ones those are at
diagnosis, &lt;a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/20/20/5182.abstract?etoc"&gt;though we&amp;#8217;re getting there&lt;/a&gt;—it can be catastrophic.
Thankfully, those cases are&amp;nbsp;rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though most chemotherapy I was ordering was &lt;a href="http://hemonc.org/wiki/Aggressive_Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma#DA-R-EPOCH"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPOCH&lt;/span&gt;-R&lt;/a&gt; or, &lt;a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02203526?term=primary+cns+lymphoma&amp;amp;rank=22"&gt;for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s new primary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNS&lt;/span&gt; lymphoma protocol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEDDI&lt;/span&gt;-R, there were
several patients with non-hematological malignancies getting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IL&lt;/span&gt;-15. If
you hadn&amp;#8217;t heard of this particular interleukin being used for treatment
before, it&amp;#8217;s becuse the results of the first-in-humans phase I trial
done by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2014/11/12/JCO.2014.57.3329.abstract"&gt;have just been published in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JCO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The maximal
tolerated dose was somewhat low when administered as an intravenous
bolus, so the patients are now getting it either as a 12-day continuous
infusion, or a subcutaneous injection. I&amp;#8217;d rather not steal Dr. Conlon&amp;#8217;s
thunder—or break any government regulations—by writing how these patients did.
Just keep an eye for a follow-up paper. And maybe a tumor board presentation
from me in the next few&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard a version of this years ago, back in Serbia, while I was still
a med student. It hadn&amp;#8217;t left much of an impression, but I can imagine myself
nodding my head and thinking &lt;em&gt;ha ha, yes, stupid Americans, ruining their own
language&lt;/em&gt;, or something comparably&amp;nbsp;obnoxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;ve, erm, matured since then. True, some euphemisms now inspire
rage instead of vague amusement, like my two&amp;nbsp;favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I just wanted to let you know&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m telling you&amp;#8221;, and its
  relatives &amp;#8220;Please let me know&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;Thank you for letting me know&amp;#8221;.
  Physicians are particularly fond of this, for we are the gatekeepers of
  knowledge, and the only reason you know something is because we are letting
  you. Don&amp;#8217;t worry though, it&amp;#8217;s not just you, we say that to each other all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t feel comfortable doing xyz&amp;#8221; instead of &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want to do
  xyz&amp;#8221;, &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/25/ten-common-residency-idioms-and-phrases"&gt;as mentioned here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them, though—particularly ones we use with patients—have a good
reason to exist. &lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/translation/"&gt;The Radiolab segment which inspired this post&lt;/a&gt;
made fun of &amp;#8220;making someone comfortable&amp;#8221; being used for dying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICU&lt;/span&gt; patients.
Instead of… what, exactly? Euthanasia? There is a difference between giving
someone drugs usualy meant for comfort—opioids, primarily—in order to kill them,
and giving them opioids for pain and comfort knowing it may shorten their&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are turns of phrase used &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are euphemisms. &amp;#8220;You
should get your affairs in order&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;your time is becoming limited&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;at
this point we should concentrate on quality of life, not quantity&amp;#8221; are
all ways of saying &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know when you&amp;#8217;ll die, but it will be soon,
so start planning the funeral&amp;#8221;. I am sure Mr. Carlin would appreciate
getting it straight, but not every patient is as stoic. We can easily
be more blunt if asked to do so, but you cannot un-hit a patient with a
sledgehammer like that. So the default is to err on the side of&amp;nbsp;softness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, most of the euphemisms we use with patients also make &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;
more comfortable with the sitation. What I wrote above may then just be
my rationalizing it away with a convenient it&amp;#8217;s-best-for-the-patient
mantra. In truth—to use another common phrase—euphemisitis is a
&lt;em&gt;multifactorial&lt;/em&gt; condition (as in, I have no idea what the reasons are,
but it&amp;#8217;s probably a little bit of&amp;nbsp;everything).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2014 15:42:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-11-03:/eng/2014/11/03/on-medical-euphemisms/</guid></item><item><title>T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/11/01/t-cellhistiocyte-rich-large-b-cell-lymphoma/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Another month, another tumor board talk.

And Palliation.</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/10/10/pain-and-palliation/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am not spiritual, or religious. Living in an atheist country that
suddenly takes a turn towards militant Christian fundamentalism does
that to you. I don&amp;#8217;t believe in woo. I do believe that American doctors
are overtreating their patients&amp;#8217; pain, and that American patients are
too sensitized to it. Yes, the understaffed orthopedic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VA&lt;/span&gt; surgery wards
where post-op patients were screaming for their morphine may have led
to the Kabuki of a nurse coming in every couple of hours to ask you
about where your pain is, and what is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUALITY&lt;/span&gt; of the pain, and
howbadisitfromonetoten? But a cancer center is no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VA&lt;/span&gt;. The ritual only
reminds those with chronic cancer pain that yes, it is still there,
and yes, it hurts more than it did 3 hours ago, and now they can&amp;#8217;t
finish reading their book because there is a twinge every couple of
minutes while they are thinking about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is all a longwinded way of saying that I should not have enjoyed the pain
and pallitavie rotation that much. There is spirituality, there is woo, there is
a lot of pain. And yet I&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people know what they are doing. They have plenty of resources
available to do it. And yes, they may &amp;#8220;do Reiki&amp;#8221;—nothing more
than elaborate Kabuki for patients with advanced diseases—but there are
times when that is exactly what the patients need. When 4am vital
signs and checking for hepatomegaly every day just aren&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some useful questions to ask your patients with any serious chronic
disease, if and when you have some extra time in&amp;nbsp;clinic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you the same person now as you were before the diagnosis? How did you&amp;nbsp;change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you fear the&amp;nbsp;most?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you hope&amp;nbsp;for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who(m) do you rely on for support?&lt;sup id="fnref:whom"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:whom" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients&amp;#8217; answers may surprise&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:whom"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Whom&amp;#8221; is gramaticaly correct, but interrpreted as pretentious
by most patients. Use it judiciously. Yes, I realize that what I have
written here is just as bad.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:whom" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iz daljine, ne čini mi se da je pravac kojim Srbija ide—ako ga ima—dobar. Isto

Ako vas je neko već pozvao, čestitam! Ako nije&lt;sup id="fnref:prijava"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:prijava" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, još nije vreme za
brigu—većina programa pozivnice šalje u talasima, svake dve-tri nedelje, sve do
kraja oktobra-sredine&amp;nbsp;novembra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ako vam ni do tada ne stigne ništa, evo šta sigurno ne treba raditi—spemovati
jadne direktore i njihove koordinatore generičkim molbama za intervju.
U najboljem slučaju će ignorisati vaš mejl, u najgorem će vas skinuti sa spiska
potencijalnih kandidata jer ne umete da pratite molbu sa sajta da ih ne
kontaktirate za takve&amp;nbsp;stvari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Šta onda? Dve stvari: ako znate nekoga ko može garantovati za
vas, zamolite ih da proslede vaše podatke koordinatoru ili direktoru koje
poznaju&lt;sup id="fnref:upozorenje"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:upozorenje" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; i ako ste
već u Americi, pošaljite mejl okolnim programima da ste dostupni u kratkom roku,
za slučaj da neki kandidat otkaže razgovor dan-dva pre. Za tako nešto je dobro biti
u mestima sa visokom koncentracijom programa koji primaju strance (čitaj: Istočna obala, Čikago).
Naravno, prijavite se na te programa preko &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ERAS&lt;/span&gt;-a &lt;em&gt;pre&lt;/em&gt; slanja&amp;nbsp;mejla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ako ste završili sve stepove ali još niste dobili &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECFMG&lt;/span&gt; sertifikat,
slobodno se prijavite—programi to obično gledaju tek kad dođe vreme za
rangiranje. Ako već morate da se prijavite bez svih stepova, Step 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CK&lt;/span&gt;
je najmanje bitan. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; je i dalje najlakši za prolaz, ali je njegovo
padanje najveća crvena zastava koju nečija aplikacija može imati, tako da se
stranci bez položenog &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;-a obično ne&amp;nbsp;pozivaju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sledeća bitna stavka su pisma preporuke. Nema svrhe plaćati prijavu za
program koji na sajtu traži četiri pisma, a vi to četvrto još čekate.
Srećom, većina je &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; i sa tri, dok se poslednje može dodati naknadno.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSPE&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;#8220;dekanovo pismo&amp;#8221;) i transkript su neophodni, ali za strane
kandidate nebitni pošto sistemi ocenjivanja nisu uporedivi. Na žalost,
to je još jedna stavka za koju morati čekati na šalterima, hodnicima
fakulteta,&amp;nbsp;itd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Srećno!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:prijava"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ili ako još niste poslali prijavu, u kom slučaju, šta kog
đavola čekate‽&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:prijava" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:upozorenje"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upozorenje: morate biti sigurni da su u
dobrim odnosima. Postoje ljudi čija bi preporuka bila garancija za brisanje sa
liste.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:upozorenje" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

patients with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACE&lt;/span&gt; inhibitor-induced angioedema? I&amp;#8217;ve had heated debates
with residents in my old clinic who did not want to even consider ARBs for
a patient with worsening diabetic nephropathy who&amp;#8217;s had lip swelling
while on an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACE&lt;/span&gt;-I &lt;em&gt;ten years ago&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the one about not giving these patients amlodipine, since there
are two—&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19299323"&gt;yes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330681"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;—case reports on amlodipine-associated
angioedema? Should we also stop giving them &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15120149"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are shellfish allergies and iodine contrast, fever and
atelectasis, morbid obesity and hypothyroidism… No matter how many
studies show these associations to be too weak to be clinicaly
significant, or just plain false, there will always be an attending
somewhere giving them as his or her pearl of the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

rotations. The one that is universally feared is the erroneously
named Bone marrow transplant service&lt;sup id="fnref:bmt"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bmt" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After spending six weeks
on such rotation fresh out of (Chief) residency, I think I can
understand&amp;#8212;-though not agree with&amp;#8212;-the reasons&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not easy. The patients are either already, or about to become,
extraordinarily sick, with little outward signs or symptoms to show
it. Having cancer while not having an immune system is not a good
combination, even if it is temporary. The ones who are months or years
out from a successful transplant and still need to be hospitalized
are usually miserable from longstanding severe graft versus host
disease&lt;sup id="fnref:bias"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bias" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It makes for a tough bunch of humans to deal with&amp;nbsp;day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, being on transplant service in an academic center can be the
apex of your inpatient career. Months of residency spent on acute care
floors and in intensive care units should have given you all the skills
you need to do well. These are, in no particular&amp;nbsp;order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarifying ambiguity&lt;/em&gt;: The rounds are over, attendings and consultants have
  dispersed, and you have just heard more facts about T-cell activation than you
  realized existed. But&amp;#8212;-do you know if that febrile-but-not-neutropenic patient
  should get an antibiotic? What&amp;#8217;s that other patient&amp;#8217;s target Tacro
  level? Send &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSF&lt;/span&gt; for flow, or just give intrathecal Methotrexate? If those
  aren&amp;#8217;t clear, you should have asked more questions, and not of the &amp;#8220;Which cells
  have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IL&lt;/span&gt;-6 receptors?&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;kind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identify attending priority&lt;/em&gt;: This is often the biggest cause of ambiguity.
  Between the floor attending, the study &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;, staff &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; consultant, and various other
  consulting services, whose advice do you heed? Not always the same person&amp;#8217;s,
  and not even in the same order. Not much you can do, except be aware of it,
  and not follow everyone&amp;#8217;s advice as soon as you hear&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asserting your autonomy&lt;/em&gt;: With all this asking and following, you may rightly ask
  if you were anything more than a glorified intern. In the field of
  hematology, oncology, and infections that affect this population, you most
  certainly are&amp;#8212;-you are, after all, still in training. Not so for most other
  matters of internal medicine. Blood pressures, fingerstick, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSH&lt;/span&gt; levels&amp;#8212;-if
  you are comfortable managing them, let the team&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being there early&lt;/em&gt;: An important trait often forgotten by senior &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; residents.
  Just getting there an hour earlier than anyone else to get the work done makes
  you look like a superstar. One hour in the early morning save three in the late&amp;nbsp;afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dictating right away&lt;/em&gt;: Like, pronto. The answer to &amp;#8220;How many pending
  dictations do you have&amp;#8221; should always be &amp;#8220;Zero&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s easier for you, and is
  just good patient care. No&amp;nbsp;excuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing everything down&lt;/em&gt;: This is How to be an intern 101, but being at least two
  years removed from internship can make you stupid. Carry the patient list and
  &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Push-Clip-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.4-mm-Black/pd/797"&gt;a good pen&lt;/a&gt; with you at all times. Yes, that includes the&amp;nbsp;restroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing here is particular to transplants&amp;#8212;-it is just good inpatient
medicine. Which may be why so many oncology fellows loathe it&amp;#8212;-it is,
after all, an outpatient specialty. Then again, stem cell transplants
are one of the few therapies we have that can cure&amp;nbsp;cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bias"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who had a stem cell transplant is
miserable&amp;#8212;-a mistaken belief many oncology fellows have after the rotation, and
a clear example of selection bias.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bias" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bmt"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stem cells used for transplants are now harvested from the
peripheral blood, not the bone marrow.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bmt" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

resident wanting to appear smart on rounds and conferences, of every
attending intent on shooting down a team member&amp;#8217;s suggestion. Five,
ten years ago it might have have signaled genuine interest. Now
it means, usually, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know anything about the subject, but I&amp;#8217;m
still calling you out on (what I think is) your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BS&lt;/span&gt;. Here, look at me! I am&amp;nbsp;evidence-based!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, nobody has posed me that question in quite a while, and I don&amp;#8217;t
remember ever asking it in any context&lt;sup id="fnref:questions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:questions" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But, honestly,
except for a few &lt;a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/7842"&gt;very well-known examples listed in this excellent
post&lt;/a&gt;, you can find &amp;#8220;evidence&amp;#8221; in the medical
literature to back up any claim. Off-the-cuff conversations during
lectures and rounds are not the best place to dissect them, especially
when one side has&amp;nbsp;seniority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:questions"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I understand asking questions means showing
interest, I&amp;#8217;ve always preferred looking things up myself. This would
make me appear either very smart or very dumb, depending on whatever
subcontious impression I made on the person in the first few minutes of
us meeting. Try to use the halo effect to your advantage.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:questions" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt;-a, univerzuma, i svega ostalog, različite tehnike vizualizacije konačnog
ishoda mogu vam pomoći da savladavate unutrašnji otpor prema&amp;nbsp;uspehu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizualizujte ovo: veliki metalni čekić koji vam ritmički razbija lobanju
u komadiće&amp;#8212;-frontalna kost na jednu stranu, zigomatična na drugu, gle, delići
sive materije lete ka plafonu; sumo rvač koji vitla tim čekićem dok vam sedi na
leđima koristi svoju drugu, slobodnu ruku da vas golica ispod pazuha, dok na
raskrvavljeno uvo šapuće stihove Bodlera&amp;#8212;-na latinskom; kolega čiji je čekić
stoji pored vas i preti da će vas tužiti ako mu odmah&amp;#8212;-Odmah!&amp;#8212;-ne
vratite isti; a vama se&amp;nbsp;piški.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dakle, moj prvi&amp;nbsp;dan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hteo sam da dođem bar jedan sat pre početka smene, ali sam se izgubio,
lutao bolnicom, i jedva stigao na vreme. Poneo sam mantil, ali ne i
stetoskop. Čekalo me je devetoro pacijenata koje je trebalo da upoznam,
pregledam, dokumentujem, itd. za nepunih sat i po. Bili su raštrkani na tri
zgrade i četiri sprata, skoro svi na kontaktnoj izolaciji&lt;sup id="fnref:izolacija"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:izolacija" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Od tih devetoro, najduži boravak imala je pacijentkinja sa već trideset i nešto dana
bolničkog staža. Za dodatnih dvadeset koliko sam je ja pratio,
završila je na dijalizi, dobila manji infarkt, dva stenta, masivni šlog,
i napustila bolnicu sa balom na bradi i cevčicom u stomaku. Diktiranje njene
otpusne liste trajalo je dva&amp;nbsp;sata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desetog pacijenta primio sam istog dana oko četiri popodne. Bio je mršav, žut,
sa transplantiranom jetrom koja otkazuje i ženom koja radi u bolnici. Skoro dve
nedelje ležao je u sobi 6012&amp;#8212;-da, još uvek pamtim broj&amp;#8212;-da bi sâm kraj
života proveo u hospisu. Ovo tada nisam znao: ako ste u bolnici, dve stvari
koje vam nikako ne trebaju su loša jetra i rodbinske veze. Još nešto što nisam
znao: šta je kog đavola&amp;nbsp;hospis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan koji je počeo u 5:30 ujutru završio se nešto posle 11 uveče. Do odlaska kući
počeo sam da mrzim: pejdžere, kontaktnu izolaciju, kompjuterski sistem,
papirnu dokumentaciju. Zavoleo sam:&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ništa. Prvog, a ni sledećeg, ni onog posle. Doručak je bio u 5 ujutru,
večera u 10, ručak sam preskakao. Vikend je bio dan za pranje veša,
kupovinu hrane, i spavanje. Srećom, samo prvih par&amp;nbsp;nedelja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U jednom trenutku—negde oko 4. jula, kada se zbog praznika smanjio broj
pacijenata—shvatio sam da imam vremena za kafu pre vizite&lt;sup id="fnref:vizita"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:vizita" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
pa i za podnevna predavanja uz&amp;#8212;-besplatan!&amp;#8212;-ručak. Počeo sam da pronalazim
prečice između spratova, naučio da nikada ne treba koristiti lift. Na trogodišnjoj
specijalizaciji, dve-tri nedelje za upoznavanje sistema i nije tako
mnogo. Ne bi bilo ni dva-tri&amp;nbsp;meseca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zato, ne dozvolite da vas spremanje &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt;-a previše potrese. Najgore tek&amp;nbsp;sledi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:izolacija"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U vreme kad sam ja bio student&amp;#8212;-ne znam da li je tako
i sada&amp;#8212;-neki hirurzi su zaboravljali da operu ruke i navuku sterilne
rukavice &lt;em&gt;pre postavljanja centralne linije&lt;/em&gt;. Gel-odora-rukavice pre
ulaska u svaku sobu bio je kulturološki šok sa jedne strane, gubljenje
dragocenih sekundi sa druge.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:izolacija" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:vizita"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vizita = &amp;#8220;rounds&amp;#8221;, možda, valjda. I da, &amp;#8220;imati vremena za kafu&amp;#8221;
znači 5 minuta za kupovinu kafe za poneti, ne pola sata-sat za divanjenje uz
cigarete.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:vizita" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, it will be a &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;-generated static site
hosted free of charge on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squarespace is an excellent service, for those who don&amp;#8217;t have the
knowledge, time, or ambition to muck around with self-hosted websites,
but have enough readers to justify the $8/month subscription. My long
commute gives me more time to play with Python, git, vim, etc, and the
$96 renewal charge was due this month. It was an easy decision to&amp;nbsp;make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having most of my posts saved as markdown files payed off, as it is
currently impossible to get a clean conversion of old Squarespace articles to
Pelican. Some links will be dead, some images temporarily unavailable, and the
three of you reading this via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; will need to&amp;nbsp;resubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2014 12:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-08-17:/eng/2014/08/17/farewell-squarespace/</guid></item><item><title>Research during residency</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/07/25/research-during-residency/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Of the three pillars of medicine, research is the most ellusive. Unless you are
in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt;/PhD program&amp;#8212;-not an option for most Europeans&amp;#8212;-you will have other
priorities in medical school. And unless your residency program has a built-in
research year, the way most surgical residencies do, you will either be way too
busy in a university or a large community program to do any research, or have
plenty of free time in a lower volume community hospital that doesn&amp;#8217;t have many
research&amp;nbsp;opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I interviewed residents-to-be last year, my first thought on seeing
a non-PhD applicant having 18 publications on his or her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CV&lt;/span&gt; wasn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;Wow,
she is a research &lt;em&gt;machine&lt;/em&gt;, we gotta have her&amp;#8221;, but rather doubt that anyone
could be that productive during medical school. More points subtracted for
thinking the interviewers would be so&amp;nbsp;gullible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated six years ago, far enough not to be able to give advice
on how to do research as a medical student. The hows and whys are
institution-specific, so anything I wrote would have to be in Serbian
anyway. Residencies, though, are similar enough to each other that I do
have some words of advice for new residents wanting to do Research! in a
community hospital, university-affiliated or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patient care trumps research.&lt;/em&gt; Unless you have already worked as an attending
  in another country before coming to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; for residency, don&amp;#8217;t waltz in to
  your PDs office on day one asking about research opportunities. Prove yourself on
  the field first, then six months later, when you&amp;#8217;re comfortable managing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVT&lt;/span&gt;
  prophylaxis, septic shock, and what not, start asking&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get your own idea?&lt;/em&gt; Common wisdom says it is better to come up
with your own question and start your own projects, since you will
be more invested in the outcome. Well, yes, sort of. Unless it is a
quick-and-dirty chart review you can do over a two-week vacation&amp;#8212;-and
even then there are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRB&lt;/span&gt; hoops you&amp;#8217;d need to jump through to get anything
done&amp;#8212;-you will get your inexperienced self into the murky world of
project management. Many brilliant ideas have died on the field of
required signatures, ambiguous data points, and impossible-to-coordinate
meetings. Which is why this next advice is&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find good mentors.&lt;/em&gt; Surrounding yourself with a few good people is orders of
  magnitude better than having many good ideas. Research topics come and go, as
  does our interest in different fields of medicine (yesterday&amp;#8217;s apoptosis is
  today&amp;#8217;s epigenetics is tomorrow&amp;#8217;s something or other). It
  is unlikely that the research your started in residency will continue onward
  into fellowship, but the knowledge, skills, and general wisdom you pick up from
  your mentors should serve you well into your career. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NB&lt;/span&gt;: don&amp;#8217;t wait for someone
  to be &amp;#8220;assigned&amp;#8221; to you&amp;#8212;-although that&amp;#8217;s what many residency programs will
  do. Seek out people who match your character and who would be able to give you
  advice in at least three fields: patient care, research methodology, and
  research topics. This can be one person, or five. And if you find an awesome
  mentor who just isn&amp;#8217;t doing any research right then, you can always write
  a&amp;nbsp;review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it Science! or quality improvement?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACGME&lt;/span&gt; is big on Quality! and
  Patient Safety! this year. Programs take notice. If you can present your
  interest as a quality improvement
  project rather than small-s-science, consider doing it. Not only
  does showing interest in quality improvement look good on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CV&lt;/span&gt;,
  your institution might have special funds for resident &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QI&lt;/span&gt; projects.
  A dedicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QI&lt;/span&gt; mentor is also a good resource, if you want a carreer as a Sith
  lor&amp;#8212;-erm, hospital&amp;nbsp;administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in research goes from &lt;em&gt;I just want something on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CV&lt;/span&gt; so I
could get a fellowship&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;When I grow up, I&amp;#8217;ll have my own lab&lt;/em&gt;, but
this applies to most people in most&amp;nbsp;circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2014 06:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-07-25:/eng/2014/07/25/research-during-residency/</guid></item><item><title>Down the vim rabithole</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/07/22/down-the-vim-rabithole/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Spending two hours each day on the train, offline and without distractions,
gives me an excuse to go down various rabbit holes that a couple of months ago
I would&amp;#8217;ve thought nothing but time wasters. Starting to read the Dark Tower
series&amp;#8212;-I&amp;#8217;m almost done with the Gunslinger&amp;#8212;-is one of them. Re-learning
vim&amp;#8212;-if dabbling with it in high school 15 years ago counts as having learned
it&amp;#8212;-is&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/077-learning-vim-with-potatowire"&gt;This episode of the Technical Difficulties
podcast&lt;/a&gt;
is what started it, followed by &lt;a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/#getting-started"&gt;a blog
post&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="file:///Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; (nay,
&lt;a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;) on the perfect setup.
Now, I may or may not continue using vim as my primary writting tool&amp;#8212;-I would
have to figure out how to integrate it into my &lt;em&gt;workflow&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;-but several things
I picked up will always be&amp;nbsp;useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git is an amazing tool for tracking changes that researchers should use&amp;nbsp;more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don&amp;#8217;t blindly edit stuff&amp;#8212;-dotfiles in this particular case&amp;#8212;-on your computer
  without understanding what those edits&amp;nbsp;mean &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solarized should be your default color theme for&amp;nbsp;anything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use your macro/keyboard shortcut app of choice (mine is Keyboard Maestro, you
  can just as easily&amp;#8212;-but not as prettily&amp;#8212;-use Better Touch Tools) to quickly
  position windows into quadrants, halves, thirds,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there might not be much difference between bash and zsh if you are a beginner,
  but zsh has the cool customizable&amp;nbsp;prompts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am writing this in vim, previewing and exporting in Marked, then posting
it manually to Squarespace. The only thing standing between me and a fancy-pants
static website engine powering this blog is there being no internet access on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MARC&lt;/span&gt; trains, and me being too cheap to get a $20-a-month personal hotspot from
Spring. That is probably for the&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2014 06:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-07-22:/eng/2014/07/22/down-the-vim-rabithole/</guid></item><item><title>June 2014, final tally</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/07/01/june-2014-final-tally/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt; orientation started today. My commute is 90-plus minutes each way, and the first four months are mostly inpatient. I will have to wait until retirement for another run like&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 16:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-07-01:/eng/2014/07/01/june-2014-final-tally/</guid></item><item><title>Goodbye, Sinai</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/06/22/goodbye-sinai/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago today was my first day as an intern at Sinai.

It&amp;#8217;s easy enough to find advice on &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2013/9/2/how-to-surviveand-thrive-inyour-intern-year"&gt;how to be well-organized, efficient, and likable&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some more tech-oriented tips I wish I knew back when I&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take photos and videos, with&amp;nbsp;permission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get an iPhone. Turn off Photo stream, or download a camera app that doesn&amp;#8217;t automatically upload to it, like &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;VSCOcam&lt;/a&gt;. When a physical exam finding is rare, stumps you, or is just cool to see, ask the patient about recording it. If you see an interesting or rare radiography image, save it. But please remove all &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information"&gt;personally identifiable information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful for: appearing smart on rounds, observing disease course, creating informative slides, posters, and written case&amp;nbsp;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep track of things you are interested&amp;nbsp;in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMR&lt;/span&gt; will have a way to create custom patient lists. Use it. If you are into hematologic malignancies, eosinophilic esophagitis, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MODY&lt;/span&gt;—or anything, really—keep track of all your patients who have it. If you don&amp;#8217;t yet know what &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt; is, keep a list of all the patients you found interesting and try to find a&amp;nbsp;pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful for: getting ideas for research and quality improvement projects, figuring out your career&amp;nbsp;path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do not copy forward, copy/paste, or use templates and&amp;nbsp;macros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my internship in 2010 so I can&amp;#8217;t believe I&amp;#8217;ll write this, but—&lt;em&gt;back in the day&lt;/em&gt; before EMRs, we wrote our progress notes and H&amp;amp;Ps by hand. This meant reviewing the med list, vital signs, and labs each morning and writing down only the important stuff; completing and recording just those parts of the physical exam that had to be done; and writing a new assessment and plan each day. &lt;em&gt;Well duh, isn&amp;#8217;t that what interns should do?&lt;/em&gt;—you might naively ask, until your second or third day on the job when a helpful senior resident shows you how to shave minutes—&lt;em&gt;minutes!&lt;/em&gt;—off your note-writing time by using some variant of copying forward, templates, or&amp;nbsp;macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tricks are a mental crutch, and a &lt;a href="http://www.acphospitalist.org/archives/2013/04/ehr.htm"&gt;known cause of documentation errors&lt;/a&gt;. They might help your handicapped intern self the first few months on the job, but will then prevent you from thinking about what you are doing and writing. A thoughtful daily review of everyone&amp;#8217;s medications and labs will turn into a quick glance over a two-page long list of 10-point single-spaced Courier New. Also, your typing speed will never improve if you only document by&amp;nbsp;clicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful for: being a good, thoughtful&amp;nbsp;doctor.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 07:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-06-03:/eng/2014/06/03/three-tech-tips-for-new-interns/</guid></item><item><title>Managing photos with Transporter, Hazel, Picturelife, and Backblaze</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/05/29/managing-photos-with-transporter-hazel-picturelife-and-backblaze/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the olden days, back when I could keep all my photos on Facebook, photo management was simple. I didn&amp;#8217;t have that many to begin with; the ones I did have were grouped around events—birthdays, vacations, etc—and easily organized into albums. I also didn&amp;#8217;t care much for privacy, or&amp;nbsp;backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then two things happened: iPhone 4S, and Dora. Every day became a photo-op, with two cameras in our pockets ready to shoot. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt; was still there for big trips and Dora&amp;#8217;s modeling yet another outrageously expensive dress. This gave&amp;nbsp;us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hundred of new photos and hours of video each month coming from four different sources (our two iPhones, a Nikon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt;, and friends with their own&amp;nbsp;cameras);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no time to sort&amp;nbsp;them;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more respect for privacy, but at the same time a need to share baby photos with&amp;nbsp;everyone;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;panic attacks whenever I thought about having to organize the mess of file names, formats, storage, and backup&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed a good method to &lt;em&gt;collect&lt;/em&gt; all the photos, &lt;em&gt;organize&lt;/em&gt; them for easy access, &lt;em&gt;retrieve&lt;/em&gt; them quickly for show-off purposes, and &lt;em&gt;back them up&lt;/em&gt; both locally and in the&amp;nbsp;cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having children usually comes at a point in your life when you care less about money and more about your time—though your progeny will do their best to relinquish you of both. The willpower-depleting effects of a toddler&amp;#8217;s tantrum are also well-documented. No surprise then that many of the tools listed below have at some point sponsored &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu"&gt;a certain Mac-centric podcast&lt;/a&gt; that has destroyed many family budgets&lt;sup id="fnref:affiliate"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affiliate" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. No regrets, though—it all&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Collecting, with &lt;a href="http://www.filetransporter.com"&gt;Transporter&amp;nbsp;Sync&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity&amp;#8217;s sake, I like systems with multiple inputs to have one central gathering node. Unfortunately, our only desktop computer is a ridiculously noisy four-year-old Windows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; which sits in a usually occupied guest bedroom. The fans that buzz with the sound of a thousand bumblebees instantly disqualify it from a job as a media server, so I had to use my Macbook Pro. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.filetransporter.com"&gt;Transporter Sync&lt;/a&gt;, that was easier than I thought possible for an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt;-only&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transporter, similarly to Dropbox, has an iOS app that automatically uploads new photos to a predetermined folder. Unlike Dropbox, there is no monthly subscription—you pay once for the device, and keep using it as long as the hard drive is working. It can also act as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAS&lt;/span&gt;-lite—having access to the folders kept only on the remote hard drive without them occupying the limited space of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt;, through a &lt;em&gt;Transporter Library&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Organizing, with &lt;a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php"&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A folder full of unsorted cryptically named JPEGs and RAWs is less than useful when your parents want to see all the photos from that trip to Naples back in&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php"&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt;, the Swiss army knife of file automation. With the rules I&amp;#8217;ve set up, it renames photos based on the date and time taken, tags them according to the device that took them, and moves them to the proper Year/Month subfolder. It does the same with our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSLR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; files, placing them in a separate folder. Since the laptop only has 256 Gb, it moves any files older that three months to Transporter Library, the &amp;#8220;special&amp;#8221; folder kept only on the external hard&amp;nbsp;drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore have the last three months&amp;#8217; worth of photos and videos organized by year and month on the laptop, and our entire collection on the external Transporter hard&amp;nbsp;drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access, with &lt;a href="https://picturelife.com/?love=ESiT3XreRGzeKT5U"&gt;Picturelife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we could get to all those photos using the Transporter iOS app, but we&amp;#8217;re not a masochists. It&amp;#8217;s slow, ugly, and not meant for browsing&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FSM&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;a href="https://picturelife.com/?love=ESiT3XreRGzeKT5U"&gt;Picturelife&lt;/a&gt;! It sucks up all our new photos and videos from the Transporter—though we&amp;#8217;ve excluded &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; files since we do have to pay for all that data&lt;sup id="fnref:raw"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:raw" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—presents them in a nice web and mobile app interface whenever we want it, and can pass them on to Facebook, Shutterfly, Flickr, or wherever else we choose. It will also, from time to time, send you a &amp;#8220;this day in the past&amp;#8221; email, with photos taken years ago. When you have as many unprocessed photos as we do, it is a great discovery&amp;nbsp;mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it can send photos to Shutterfly with just a couple of clicks? I still have flashbacks of the last holiday season, progress bar dragging glacially, the upload finishing just in time for me to miss the shipping deadline. Good&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backup, with &lt;a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00n2ui"&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html"&gt;SuperDuper!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping everything on the Transporter and Picturelife as on-site/off-site backups would probably be enough for some. Unfortunately, counting on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;-backed company that might at any point &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup"&gt;pull an Everpix&lt;/a&gt; to hold all our photos does not seem optimal&lt;sup id="fnref:plife"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:plife" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is way &lt;a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00n2ui"&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html"&gt;SuperDuper!&lt;/a&gt; keep copies of all those photos as a part of my general backup system&lt;sup id="fnref:bb"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bb" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If you have a Mac and an extra external hard drive, you should also turn on Time Machine. This way, there are three local copies of all the photos, RAWs, and videos (Transporter, SuperDuper! image, Time Machine), a cloud backup of the same (Backblaze), and an easily-accessible collection of JPGs and videos&amp;nbsp;(Picturelife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this up is neither cheap nor simple&lt;sup id="fnref:rg"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rg" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it gives you quick and easy access to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your photos, has several levels of backup, and—most importantly—requires little effort to&amp;nbsp;maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bb"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backblaze &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; back up the Transporter Library folder, since it doesn&amp;#8217;t count as network-attached storage. It doesn&amp;#8217;t back up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAS&lt;/span&gt; drives.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bb" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:raw"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; files in a separate folder, one that&amp;#8217;s not on Picturelife&amp;#8217;s monitor list&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:raw" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:affiliate"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why this post has affiliate links.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:affiliate" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:plife"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, Picturelife is the best of its kind and I strongly recommend it.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:plife" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:rg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about illustrating it with a diagram of a Rube Goldberg machine.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rg" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens are dead, and tens of thousands misplaced. Government officials are having nervous breakdowns on live &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, calling the flood &amp;#8220;a Biblical catastrophe&amp;#8221;—since touting vast water resources as your country&amp;#8217;s main asset isn&amp;#8217;t a hint as to what big disaster you should prepare for. In case you&amp;#8217;re wondering, the Netherlands&amp;#8217; last big flood was in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_flood_of_1953"&gt;1953&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course a high priest&lt;sup id="fnref:frp"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:frp" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the Serbian Orthodox Church blamed it on Gay Pride. Because religion&lt;sup id="fnref:prayer"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:prayer" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a couple of minutes, please use &lt;a href="http://paypal.com"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; to donate to floodrelief@gov.rs, the official account of the Serbian diplomatic mission in Brussels. If your bank allows international wire transfers, &lt;a href="http://www.redcross.org.rs/arhiva_Донације_2441"&gt;you can give directly to the Serbian Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;. While no one we know is affected, my grandparents had to leave their home twice over the past 50 years because of floods. The support they and their neighbors received from the Red Cross on both occasions was&amp;nbsp;invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ilic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprise there. &lt;a href="http://srbin.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/velja-ilic-toma-je-cuvao-groblje-u-kragujevcu-on-je-bruka-za-srbiju-video.jpg"&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; is the head of Serbia&amp;#8217;s department for emergency response.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ilic" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:prayer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be that sarcastic, since the Orthodox Church is, in fact, trying to help. &lt;a href="http://www.spc.rs/eng/prayer_supplication_cessation_rain_served"&gt;By praying for the rain to stop&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:prayer" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:frp"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#8217;t organized religion just an excuse for LARPing.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:frp" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2014 14:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-05-18:/eng/2014/05/18/just-cant-get-a-break/</guid></item><item><title>A podcast a day</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/05/14/a-podcast-a-day/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: The average Maryland to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; commute is the second longest in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, right after New York. I should know. Mine will be 90+ minutes, come July 1st. Last week, while I was finishing paperwork at my new employer&amp;#8217;s Bethesda offices, the looks people gave me went from incredulity to pity on seeing the Baltimore address on my driver&amp;#8217;s license and hearing my explanation that no, since my wife is still at Sinai and usually just walks to work, we won&amp;#8217;t move. It&amp;#8217;s better for me to take one for the team, I&amp;#8217;d say, than have both of us suffer hellish beltway traffic from some midway&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write an essay on how &lt;em&gt;taking one for the team&lt;/em&gt; is not entirely true, but the title of this post says &amp;#8220;podcast&amp;#8221;, and it&amp;#8217;s already the second paragraph, so here is my point: My commute will be long. I will need to fill that time with &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes, that will be strangers talking into my ear about things I don&amp;#8217;t understand. Here is my list of strangers, carefully curated after ten years of&amp;nbsp;listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday: &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu"&gt;Mac Power&amp;nbsp;Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comes out every Monday morning, like clockwork. Great for learning about new hardware, productivity apps, etc. but podcasts are not the best medium for going into the minutia of somebody&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday: &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w"&gt;Back to&amp;nbsp;Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/merlin-mann"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;. Having Merlin Mann talk for an hour all by himself would be good enough, but Dan Benjamin—the other half of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt;—is the best podcast host in &lt;em&gt;the business&lt;/em&gt;. By using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cmaaarrr/status/466258733426020352"&gt;a simple formula&lt;/a&gt;, it is easy to mathematically prove that their show is the best podcast ever&amp;nbsp;created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 30 or so minutes are laden with inside jokes and obscure references, but even that is fun after you are several episodes&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday: &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/"&gt;Wait,&amp;nbsp;wait…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It airs each Saturday, but I like alliteration, and there is nothing else good on Wednesdays. I was in Chicago once while it was being taped, but was too late to get a ticket. Now that &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/05/09/310749408/bye-carl-wait-wait-bids-farewell-to-our-official-judge-and-scorekeeper"&gt;Carl Kasell&lt;/a&gt; is retiring, it&amp;#8217;s unlikely I&amp;#8217;ll ever be at a live show. So it&amp;nbsp;goes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thursday: &lt;a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/"&gt;The Talk&amp;nbsp;Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net"&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; is a better blog than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTS&lt;/span&gt; is a podcast—John Gruber and some of his guests tend to ramble—but you can get good insights on baseball and&amp;nbsp;bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friday: &lt;a href="http://atp.fm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word: &lt;a href="http://hypercritical.co"&gt;Siracusa&lt;/a&gt;. There are two other co-hosts, whose main job is not to screw up too badly. They do it&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday: &lt;a href="http://www.nerdist.com/podcast_channel/the-alton-browncast-channel/"&gt;The Alton&amp;nbsp;Browncast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; • Any co-production with Planet Money is a must-listen. Otherwise&amp;nbsp;formulaic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic"&gt;Systematic&lt;/a&gt; • Hit-and-miss, though usually a&amp;nbsp;hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us"&gt;Technical Difficulties&lt;/a&gt; • A tech &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DYI&lt;/span&gt; show with show notes better than some&amp;nbsp;books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMD&lt;/span&gt;+Space&lt;/a&gt; • I only listen to it when an interesting guest is on, which is once every couple of&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spremanje i polaganje Stepa 1 nije ni blizu trudnoće i porođaja, ali je efekat na pamćenje sličan-koliko je god meni i drugima čitava procedura bila stresna, gledano unazad sve to i nije bilo tako strašno. Najviše zbog onoga što dolazi&amp;nbsp;posle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dakle, dobili ste svojih 250+ poena na Stepu 1. Čestitam! Šta&amp;nbsp;sad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na red dolazi ono što je trebalo da planirate od samog&amp;nbsp;početka:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nalaženje bolnice u &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAD&lt;/span&gt; u kojoj možete uraditi clerkship (ako ste student) ili observership (ako ste&amp;nbsp;diplomirali);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traženje pisama preporuke na gore navedenim&amp;nbsp;mestima;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iznalaženje pisama preporuke sa fakulteta u Srbiji (bar jednog; sva četiri ako nemate uspeha sa korakom&amp;nbsp;iznad);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;spremanje i polaganje Stepa 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CK&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; u junu i&amp;nbsp;julu;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prijavljivanje na &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/students/medstudents/eras/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ERAS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; u&amp;nbsp;septembru;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;razgovori od oktobra do&amp;nbsp;februara;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iščekivanje &lt;a href="http://www.nrmp.org"&gt;Meča&lt;/a&gt; u&amp;nbsp;martu;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;skupljanje dokumentacije za vizu i licenciranje od aprila do juna &lt;sup id="fnref:viza"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:viza" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;najstresniji meseci vašeg života u julu, ako imate sreće, ili nazad na prvi korak ako&amp;nbsp;nemate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svaka od ovih stavki zaslužuje svojih petstotinak reči, a o ovoj poslednjoj su pisanje knjige&lt;sup id="fnref:knjige"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:knjige" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Ako ništa drugo, iskustvo polaganja Stepa 1 je dobra priprema za ono što&amp;nbsp;sledi.&lt;/p&gt;

Before you scream Embargo!, neither my wife nor I are American citizens. Our daughter is, but it is fortunately not illegal for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; citizens to visit Cuba as long as they don&amp;#8217;t spend any money there, at least according to &lt;a href="http://www.travel.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/travel/cuba-doing-it-your-way.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;America&amp;#8217;s most esteemed journal of law, medicine and gastronomy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for whatever reason you want to travel to Cuba from the East coast, you might find our experience&amp;nbsp;helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;flight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the United flight from Dulles to Cancun, went through Mexican customs and immigration, then took the Cubana flight to Havana after checking in again. Inbound, layover time was more than 3 hours so we could have comfortably checked a bag or two for those large bottles of sunscreen and other essential liquids. The trip back, however, was tight at 1h 55min, so we decided not to risk waisting time at baggage claim, and only brought&amp;nbsp;carry-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it was half of a good move. On the way back, going through customs, immigration, then walking from Cancun&amp;#8217;s Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 and checking in for the flight to Dulles is barely manageable in those 90-ish minutes after leaving the plane. However, we could—and should—have checked one of the carry-ons on the inbound flight, as sunscreen, diaper cream, and other toiletries are ridiculously expensive in&amp;nbsp;Havana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NB&lt;/span&gt;: You can easily walk from Cancun&amp;#8217;s Terminal 2 Arrivals to Terminal 3 Departures (or 3 -&amp;gt; 2 inbound). There is a shuttle that leaves every 30 minutes and goes Parking -&amp;gt; T1 -&amp;gt; T2 -&amp;gt; T3 -&amp;gt; Parking. The Cancun airport staff told us it would take us 25 minutes to walk from T2 to T3—and that it would take the shuttle at least as much since it makes those other stops—but hey! there&amp;#8217;s this van that magically appeared which would drive us to T3 for the low low price of $20. Google maps said it&amp;#8217;s less than a kilometer between terminals 2 and 3 so we smiled politely and walked away. It took us—three adults with a carry-on and a large shoulder bag each, plus a toddler in tow—less than 10 minutes. Kudos to United for letting us skip the long check-in line and making it to our flight without&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serbian citizens don&amp;#8217;t require a visa, but Dora had only her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; passport. We got her a visa in Cancun at check-in for 20&amp;nbsp;euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuban entry stamp is bright pink. They asked us before putting one in Dora&amp;#8217;s passport, so I can only assume they occasionally get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; citizens who&amp;#8217;d rather not have their passports stamped for whatever reason (cough, cough). The visa also gets stamped, so there is still proof of&amp;nbsp;entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no issues going back through Dulles. The customs form asks you which countries you visited on the trip, so we did write we were in Cuba. The immigration officer at Dulles just asked if we were bringing any cigars back with us—of course not, we hadn&amp;#8217;t even smoked any while there!—and finished the fingerprinting in record&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring euros, and bring more than you expect. You can convert &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; to convertible pesos (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUC&lt;/span&gt;) in any exchange office, but with their rates it&amp;#8217;s better to change dollars to euros in your own bank, then change euros to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUC&lt;/span&gt; once in Cuba. Also, convert some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUC&lt;/span&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;peso nacional&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUP&lt;/span&gt;), if only for the ridiculously cheap ice cream you can buy on the&amp;nbsp;street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how much to bring, count on &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; $20/person/day, not including the room or the 25 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUC&lt;/span&gt; exit tax. This would cover lunch, dinner, and a daily trip to the beach or a visit to a museum, monument, etc. Since you cannot use American credit/debit cards anywhere on the island, it pays to take more than you think you would&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Homestay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the trip! We booked &lt;a href="http://www.homestay.com/cuba/havana/4956-homestay-in-centro-habana-havana"&gt;this room&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.homestay.com"&gt;homestay.com&lt;/a&gt;, and could not be happier with how it turned out. Centro Habana, the neighborhood it&amp;#8217;s in, is definitely not for everyone—very safe, like the rest of Cuba, but also with dog poop and open trash cans everywhere you turn&lt;sup id="fnref:naples"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:naples" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Our &lt;em&gt;casa particular&lt;/em&gt; was the opposite—clean, well-maintained, gaudy, but cute. Between our large air-conditioned room, the patio, and the open rooftop terrace, we could easily have spent a couple of days just hanging out there chatting with the friendly&amp;nbsp;hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t count on being able to get online at any point. We tried checking in online a day before the trip back, but none of the Havana Vieja hotels we tried had any prepaid cards available. Even if they had, there are no printers to print a boarding pass. Unless you&amp;#8217;re staying in a hotel, don&amp;#8217;t even think about wi-fi. Just bring a good book or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if someone&amp;#8217;s vacations response email tells you they&amp;#8217;re going to Cuba, don&amp;#8217;t count on them having any access, &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanleys-parker-on-email-access-2014-4"&gt;no matter what some self-important douche bag tells you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guidebooks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only resource we used—and we used it multiple times per day—was the &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/havana-good-time/id385663683?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Havana Good Time iPhone app&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the information on working hours and prices is slightly outdated, but it is all still relevant, and it comes with an offline map of Havana that is—duh—much easier to carry around than the paper&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other DOs and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;Ts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do take the Havana tour double decker bus at least&amp;nbsp;once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do go to the Revolution Museum—the clunky propagandist English translations alone are worth the 8 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUC&lt;/span&gt; admission&amp;nbsp;fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do try the excellent Coppelito ice&amp;nbsp;cream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t waste an hour standing in line to pay for it with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUP&lt;/span&gt;—support their economy, and pay for it in hard currency like the tourist you&amp;#8217;re pretending not to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t give any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUC&lt;/span&gt; to street performers, especially the kind that chases you down the street with a&amp;nbsp;guitar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do throw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUP&lt;/span&gt; at&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t drink the tap&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:naples"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could say the same about the part of Naples we stayed in this January. In fact, with laundry out in the open and being able to peek into people&amp;#8217;s living rooms from ground level it looked very much like Naples, just with wider streets.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:naples" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s doubly painful when I know I have institutional access via my library&amp;#8217;s proxy server, but have to jump through hoops to get it: go to the library website, log in, copy and paste the article name or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMID&lt;/span&gt; into its PubMed search box, and finally download the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;. Arduous, and—turns&amp;nbsp;out—unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.alfredapp.com"&gt;Alfred 2&lt;/a&gt; workflows. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/634331"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a nice article&lt;/a&gt; I found on Twitter today. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEJM&lt;/span&gt; link in the top right corner leads to an abstract, but I need a special archive subscription for the full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;. No matter—I can just highlight the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMID&lt;/span&gt; and hit my special Alfred 2 keyboard&amp;nbsp;combo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;#8217;m not already logged into the Welch library proxy, I hit a login wall. It&amp;#8217;s nothing &lt;a href="http://1password.com"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; can&amp;#8217;t solve, but you can also just type in your username and password yourself, &lt;a href="http://skreened.com/unvisual/like-an-animal"&gt;like an animal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Bam! The ugly but magic button is where it should be. Your institution might have a prettier&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it clear—this simple workflow will do a PubMed search of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; selected text &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X, all through your institutional proxy server. Finding an interesting reference while reading an article, highlighting its title, and hitting ^⎇⌘P to get to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; always feels like&amp;nbsp;magic.&lt;/p&gt;

Kako da gledam decu koja sede u poslastičarnici dok im sa stola pored dolazi oblak karcinogena? Šta da kažem njihovoj majci koja puši za tim istim stolom? Zašto posle svakog izlaska u grad moram da vetrim&amp;nbsp;odeću?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovo nije pitanje estetike i tolerancije. &lt;a href="http://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/blog/2014/01/where-theres-smoke-theres-cancer"&gt;Gde ima pušača ima i raka&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isto važi za kardivaskularne bolesti, bolesti pluća, šlog… Kako, onda, prioritet Ministarstva Zdravlja nije potpuna zabrana pušenja? Da li srpski budžet toliko zavisi od poreza na duvan? Ili Filip Moris i ostali toliko dobro lobiraju? Zašto država duvanskim parama ne bi subvencionisala &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette"&gt;elektronske cigarete&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ako mi bilo koji pušač kaže da je zabrana pušenja na svim javnim mestima kršenje njegovih ili njenih ljudskih prava, pitam ih da li je i zabrana uriniranja na gradskim trgovima kršenje nečijih prava? Koja je razlika između pušenja i pišanja u&amp;nbsp;javnosti?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2014 05:52:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-01-14:/srb/2014/01/14/kako-ljudi-u-srbiji-prezivljavaju-teror-pusaca/</guid></item><item><title>Why doctors shouldn’t use Google services</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/01/13/why-doctors-shouldnt-use-google-services/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a Google+ account—and you might not be aware that you do—anyone using Gmail &lt;a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/reach-people-you-know-more-easily.html"&gt;can now email you&lt;/a&gt; without knowing your address. You can disable this &amp;#8220;feature&amp;#8221; in the settings, but having it be opt-out shows yet again how little Google cares about&amp;nbsp;privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that there&amp;#8217;s anything wrong with that—privacy is a relatively modern invention that younger generations might not care for as much as we do. But you should understand the implications of patients and random strangers being able to leave messages in your personal inbox. Suing P.,,,,,,kmmmmmqmmmdoctors is &lt;a href="http://www.innovateus.net/content/medicine-code-hammurabi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a modern invention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I stopped using all Google services—search included—years ago. The company has become so large, with so many users, that it doesn&amp;#8217;t need to cater to fringe interests. And for a business with billions of users, doctors are a fringe group—one that hates &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution"&gt;change-for-change&amp;#8217;s-sake&lt;/a&gt;, having to [re-learn an interface][ n. Nnjm   interface] &amp;#8220;just because&amp;#8221;, and not being &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/youre-not-googles-custome_b_841599.html"&gt;the true customer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:emr"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:emr" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the number of people at Google who may access my data is huge. &lt;a href="http://www.ownmail.net/?STKI=10207929"&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:referral"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:referral" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my email provider of choice, has fewer than 10 employees. Gmail alone has hundreds. Not that anyone would be interested in me in particular, but if I ever inadvertently send or receive private patient information through my personal account, I&amp;#8217;d rather as few people as possible see&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email is fine, but why abandon search? First, I have googled enough ailments and substances, common and obscure, that the add network thought I was an elderly female recovering heroin addict with more than one &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia"&gt;paraphilia&lt;/a&gt;. The adds I would get were in that sense appropriate. Second, because of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEO&lt;/span&gt; the only valuable page-one results I would get were Wikipedia entries. Everything else was a hodgepodge of useless Livestrong, Huffington post and five-pages-per-500-word-article-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;-behind-a-login-wall Medscape links. &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com"&gt;Duckduckgo&lt;/a&gt; and, yes, &lt;a href="http://bing.com"&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt; at least help with the first problem while not making the second one any&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google calendar is the only service I would consider using. It is fast, reliable, omnipresent and easy to use. There is, however, that constant nagging fear that they will find &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way to integrate it with Google+ and yet again sacrifice functionality to force people into its circle&lt;sup id="fnref:heh"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:heh" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is why I use Apple&amp;#8217;s iCloud calendar, its horrendous web interface and&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: Reader. I use &lt;a href="https://feedwrangler.net/"&gt;FeedWrangler&lt;/a&gt; now, but &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors&amp;#8217; concerns aside, Google is all set to become the network &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:ms"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ms" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the internet—large, bland, and largely not relevant to the people who are. It is already two-thirds of the way&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one in particular, as it keeps reminding me that doctors are second-class citizens in the tech world.

Da li bi sve&amp;nbsp;ponovo?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovakva pitanja mi često stižu na mejl. Kratki odgovor je—da,&amp;nbsp;apsolutno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naravno, odlaskom nisam rešio sva životna pitanja, već sam jedan skup problema zamenio drugim. Ne moram da razmišljam iz koje stranke je šef odeljenja na kome volontiram a iz koje direktor bolnice, i u kakvim su odnosima; da li će me pacijenti gledati popreko jer su lekari po definiciji ili korumpirani ili nesposobni&lt;sup id="fnref:sposobnost"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sposobnost" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; da li ću sa 30 godina još uvek biti na grbači roditelja, i kako &lt;a href="http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Pogledi-sa-strane/t45150.lt.html"&gt;odgajati sopstvenu decu u Srbiji 2013-te&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umesto toga, trošim vreme i novac na polaganje milion testova za licenciranje&lt;sup id="fnref:testovi"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:testovi" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; i razgovore za subspecijalizaciju&lt;sup id="fnref:fellowship"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:fellowship" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; pacijenti me gledaju popreko jer su lekari po definiciji bezobrazno bogati; slobodnog vremena nemam puno, jer mi prosečan radni dan traje 12 sati a skoro svaki vikend trošim na manijakalno Skajpovanje sa prijateljima i porodicom&lt;sup id="fnref:dora"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dora" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Po onome što sam čuo od prijatelja, pretpostavljam da bih negde u Zapadnoj Evropi u zamenu za slobodnije vikende i blizinu Srbije dobio zatvorenost prema imigrantima i ograničena mogućnost za napredovanje&lt;sup id="fnref:usa"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:usa" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, za mene još i uz gubitak vremena na učenje još jednog stranog jezika. Sve ima&amp;nbsp;svoje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stručni i lični izazovi ostaju: praćenje literature, pregovaranje sa pacijentima, veš mašina koja zbog koje misteriozno iskače osigurač u različitim delovima ciklusa, a savršeno radi kad dođe majstor… Ali, lepo je baviti se tim stvarima bez stalnog straha da će se država urušiti oko vas. Dodatni bonus u Americi je što je većina ljudi ili zadovoljna svojim poslom ili aktivno traži bolji, što je mnogo bolja atmosfera za život i rad od stalnog slušanja jadikovki—često potpuno opravdanih—o teškom životu ljudi oko&amp;nbsp;vas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A roditelji? Dovedite ih kod sebe gde god da ste, i čim budete mogli. Srbija &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBqmKSAHc6w"&gt;nije zemlja za starce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Srećom sam zbog porodične situacije bio ograničen na lokalne programe.

&lt;p&gt;Ovde sam bez ikakvog prethodnog radnog iskustva završio specijalizaciju iz interne u bolnici u kojoj sam sad glavni specijalizant, a od 1. jula počinjem subspecijalizaciju iz hematologije/onkologije na &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCI&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt;.

It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve read it, but the introduction reminded me of what I thought was its biggest fault in&amp;nbsp;reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… But now many doctors admit that alternative medicine often seems to do a better job of making patients well, and at a much lower cost, than mainstream care—and they’re trying to learn from&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative medicine does not make patients well. It makes them &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; well. The difference is&amp;nbsp;huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two graphs from an excellent &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1103319#t=article"&gt;free-to-access &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEJM&lt;/span&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; that compared four methods of treating asthma: conventional medicine, placebo, sham acupuncture, and doing nothing&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The first one shows how well the patients in each group &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; after 2-4 weeks of&amp;nbsp;treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah ha! Conventional medicine was no better than sham (&lt;em&gt;sham!&lt;/em&gt;) acupuncture, and both beat placebo inhalers. Alternative medicine wins! Or did conventional medicine lose? At the very least it&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. The second graphs shows the amount of objective improvement, measured in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FEV1&lt;/span&gt;—the volume of air you exhale during the first second of breathing&amp;nbsp;out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were the common cold, it wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been a big deal. But asthma is not the common cold. People die of it every day, not because they didn&amp;#8217;t feel well—though being unable to breathe is doubtlessly uncomfortable—but because their airways were too tight to get any air out of the&amp;nbsp;lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why alternative medicine can be dangerous in the wrong hands, with the wrong patient. Improving quality of life is important, but so is &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2013/ReportNationDec2013Release"&gt;curing disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding real acupuncture to the interventions would have made the study perfect. Some other time, perhaps.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Every night, its army of gnomes will go over my tweets, blog posts, completed to-dos, etc. and record them in a &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id422304217?mt=12&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; journal entry. Not a replacement for a real journal, true, but better than anything I could do on my&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a Mac-only app that runs from the command line—not user friendly at all. Even so, the installation instructions are straightforward, with some caveats for the not-too-bright, like&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin configuration is done in each individual &lt;em&gt;plugin&lt;/em&gt;.rb file, not&amp;nbsp;slogger_config.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All config strings (URLs, file paths, usernames…) should be in quotes (&amp;#8220;…&amp;#8221;), even when in an array (i.e. in square brackets). The Twitter plugin instructions wrongly give an example without&amp;nbsp;quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Instapaper plugin doesn&amp;#8217;t work since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds for folders are no longer supported. I&amp;#8217;m still not switching to&amp;nbsp;Pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need an &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; account to log your Facebook posts, using &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/56242"&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://simplicitybliss.com/integrating-slogger-and-runkeeper/"&gt;Instructions for logging RunKeeper activity&lt;/a&gt; are convoluted, but&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slogger&amp;#8217;s default time for sucking in your data is 11:50pm, when my laptop is usually in sleep mode. The scheduler should still be smart enough to start the app on wake-up. Nevertheless, it&amp;#8217;s one more reason for me to get a used Mac Mini. In 2015,&amp;nbsp;perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 19:28:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2014-01-01:/eng/2014/01/01/starting-the-new-year-with-slogger/</guid></item><item><title>Two podcasts, three doctors, one good show</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/29/two-podcasts-three-doctors-one-good-show/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two months, two of my must-listen podcasts, &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic"&gt;Systematic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu"&gt;Mac Power User&lt;/a&gt;, have had medical professionals on as guests. I don&amp;#8217;t usually listen to medical podcasts—Twitter and saved PubMed searches are big enough firehoses—so I thought it would be interesting to hear how my more experienced colleagues use technology. Two of the three episodes were underwhelming, one was&amp;nbsp;stellar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/69"&gt;Brett Terprstra and Dr. Pamela Peeke&lt;/a&gt; on Systematic. She has several books targeted towards lay public, and the episode went in the same vein—broad advice on nutrition, well-being, etc. I cringed more than once, but that was to be expected—public health information relies on overplaying the risks and simplifying facts to the point of absurdity&lt;sup id="fnref:forecasts"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:forecasts" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The one thing I could agree with was how important meditation can be, as mindful meditation might decrease physician burnout. Negative points for not mentioning &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0861719069/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0861719069&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20"&gt;Mindfulness in Plain English&lt;/a&gt; as essential reading, though I haven&amp;#8217;t read Dr. Peeke&amp;#8217;s own recommendation, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807012394/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0807012394&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20"&gt;The Miracle of Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had higher hopes for &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/169"&gt;Episode 169 of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, since Katie Floyd&amp;#8217;s and David Sparks&amp;#8217;s guest, Dr. Jeffrey Taekman, has &lt;a href="http://wippp.com/blog/"&gt;an excellent productivity blog&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, McSparky spent more than half of the show being fascinated by the minutiae of what doctors do. Which is better than what followed—long periods of uncomfortable silence while the unprepared guest clicked through every app in his menu bar to see if there is anything worth mentioning&lt;sup id="fnref:time"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:time" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There&amp;nbsp;wasn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another episode of Systematic came on, &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/76"&gt;with Dr. Don Schaffner, a microbiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:phd"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:phd" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was outstanding. Brett was a better interviewer than David, and avoided getting too side-tracked by his guest&amp;#8217;s interesting work. But ultimately, the show was good because Dr. Schaffner had useful tips and app recommendations that did not simply regurgitate the latest round of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPU&lt;/span&gt;/Mactories/Macdrifter/etc. sponsors. His paper review workflow gave me several ideas I will work on during the holiday downtime. He also suggested &lt;a href="http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/hf3.html"&gt;a promising contender&lt;/a&gt; in my quest to find headphones that will survive more than 8-12 months of intensive&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing for me to do during the downtime: promote &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org"&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt;. Between &lt;a href="http://blog.macademic.org/2013/10/18/papers-3-a-step-in-the-wrong-direction/"&gt;the developers fumbling Papers 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/19/how-one-publisher-is-stopping-academics-from-sharing-their-research/"&gt;Mendeley being taken over by an evil corporation&lt;/a&gt;, Zotero coupled with a few extensions is the best reference manager on any platform. Coming in&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:forecasts"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;a href="http://www.bdkeller.com/2012/09/why-we-should-lie-about-the-weather-and-maybe-more/"&gt;weather forecasts&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:forecasts" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:time"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, it was not total silence. You could hear Katie fuming in the background.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:time" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:phd"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhD, not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt;. Wonder if that explains why the show was better.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:phd" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t feel comfortable doing that.&lt;/em&gt;—I don&amp;#8217;t know what you&amp;#8217;re asking me to do (nurse to intern); I&amp;#8217;m too lazy to do it (intern to resident); I think it&amp;#8217;s a stupid idea and there&amp;#8217;s no way you can make me do it (resident to attending); You&amp;#8217;re not paying me enough to do this crap (attending to&amp;nbsp;administration).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a light elective&lt;/em&gt;—You don&amp;#8217;t need to show&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Needs to read more.&lt;/em&gt; (on a written evaluation)—I have no idea how much medicine this person knows. I barely know any&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The family is reasonable.&lt;/em&gt;—Family members don&amp;#8217;t ask too many questions and will agree with anything you&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patient has xyz&lt;/em&gt;.—I&amp;#8217;ve read in an old discharge summary that the patient has &lt;em&gt;xyz&lt;/em&gt;, but have no idea how they established the diagnosis, what stage it is in, or what the hell &lt;em&gt;xyz&lt;/em&gt; even&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation. Sclearae are nonicteric.&lt;/em&gt;—If I were to report the physical exam I actually did it would take five nanoseconds, so take these fillers to make it seem like I&amp;#8217;ve put in some&amp;nbsp;effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for the thorough presentation.&lt;/em&gt;—Why did you waste my time with all that useless&amp;nbsp;information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&amp;#8217;s an outpatient work-up.&lt;/em&gt;—Administration is already breathing down my neck because of this patient&amp;#8217;s length of stay and you&amp;#8217;re worried about a mild anemia and a positive&amp;nbsp;hemoccult!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&amp;#8217;s her new baseline.&lt;/em&gt;—Her disease is worse and we don&amp;#8217;t know why, so I guess she&amp;#8217;s stuck with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please let me know if you have any more questions.&lt;/em&gt;—This is the end of our conversation, so please stop talking. I shall now&amp;nbsp;leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2013 13:52:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2013-12-25:/eng/2013/12/25/ten-common-residency-idioms-and-phrases/</guid></item><item><title>As a one-time interviewer and two-time interviewee…</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/18/as-a-one-time-interviewer-and-two-time-interviewee/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thebiopsy.com/post/70322343598/entrepreneurialism-medical-school"&gt;…to me, this looks flaky&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, Scott Adams (of-Dilbert-fame) is right in saying &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846919/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1591846919&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20"&gt;your best bet for success in life&lt;/a&gt; is being pretty good in several skills rather than trying to be the best ever in only one. So, a plan like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step one: become a decent&amp;nbsp;entrepreneur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step two: become a decent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step three:&amp;nbsp;???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step four:&amp;nbsp;profit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;might indeed be a good idea.&amp;nbsp;However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine implies altruism. Entrepreneurship implies&amp;nbsp;greed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programs want their residents to be 100% dedicated to medicine in general and the program in particular. Can you do that with a small business on the&amp;nbsp;side?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physicians in academia, i.e. those who conduct residency interviews, forgo 300k+ salaries so they could dedicate themselves to research and education. Are you sure telling them about your latest money-making scheme is a good&amp;nbsp;idea?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a resident, do you look at each patient as an opportunity to help them and learn from them, or to figure out how to build a business around&amp;nbsp;them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residency programs exist to train physicians, not CEOs. Residency slots are already in short supply. Would program directors give a position to someone who is more likely to end up not practicing medicine at&amp;nbsp;all?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 18:24:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2013-12-18:/eng/2013/12/18/as-a-one-time-interviewer-and-two-time-interviewee/</guid></item><item><title>USMLE, ponovo</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2013/12/14/usmle-ponovo/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Dve i po godine &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/srb/2011/03/21/usmle"&gt;od mog prvog teksta o polaganju &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt;-a&lt;/a&gt;, malo toga se promenilo. Goljan je i dalje odličan za patologiju (i više od pola Stepa 1), ali se u međuvremenu pojavila i &lt;a href="http://www.pathoma.com"&gt;Patoma&lt;/a&gt;. Potpuno su eliminisali dvocifreni skor jer je zbunjivao ljude. Zbog sve boljih prosečnih rezultata minimalni prolazni trocifreni će od Januara 2014. biti 192 umesto 188&lt;sup id="fnref:skor"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:skor" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralni deo pripreme i dalje bi trebalo da budu fleš kartice. Android tableti i telefoni su sada mnogo dostupniji&lt;sup id="fnref:tablet"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tablet" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;a href="http://ankisrs.net"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; je i dalje prvi izbor, ali &lt;a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=flash+card+spaced+repetition+android&amp;amp;form=APMCS1"&gt;ne i jedini&lt;/a&gt;. Proces je&amp;nbsp;jednostavan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročitajte ovlaš poglavlje iz First&amp;nbsp;Aid-a.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Za oblasti za koje je preporučen još neki (opširniji) udžbenik, pročitajte samo one oblasti iz tog udžbenika koji se spominju u First Aid-u&lt;sup id="fnref:mmrs"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mmrs" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročitajte još jednom sekundarni udžbenik, dopisujući u First Aid stvari koje mislite da treba&amp;nbsp;zapamtiti&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pročitajte još jednom First Aid, podvlačeći stvari koje mislite da treba da idu na fleš kartice&lt;sup id="fnref:kartice"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kartice" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napravite fleš kartice od svih podvučenih stvari iz First Aid-a, i svih stvari koje ste iz sekundarnog udžbenika ubacili u Frist&amp;nbsp;Aid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ako ste sve uradili kako treba, na to poglavlje First Aid-a ne bi trebalo ni da se vraćate. Već ste ga prešli tri puta, a sve što još niste zapamtili je u karticama. Proveravajte se karticama &lt;em&gt;svaki dan&lt;/em&gt;, u prevozu, dok čekate u redu, na dosadnim predavanjima. Zato je bitno imati telefon ili&amp;nbsp;tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dva-tri meseca pred ispit, uplatite &lt;a href="http://www.usmleworld.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; World&lt;/a&gt;, i počnite sa tim pitanjima. Kad sam poslednji put gledao, bilo ih je oko 3.000 za Step 1 i 1.800 za Step 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CK&lt;/span&gt;. Mesec dana pred ispit uplatite neki od &lt;a href="http://www.nbme.org/Students/sas/sas.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBME&lt;/span&gt; testova&lt;/a&gt;, vidite gde ste i na šta bi trebalo da obratite više&amp;nbsp;pažnje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sâm proces prijave za specijalizaciju se nije promenio&lt;sup id="fnref:intervjui"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:intervjui" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Zbog novih medicinskih fakulteta sve više Amerikanaca bira internu medicinu, ali nema ništa manje &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FMG&lt;/span&gt;-eva. Neki programi će uvek pre izabrati Amerikanca sa lošijim skorovima od nekoga na J1 vizi sa 260 na oba stepa, ali ne svi, čak ne ni većina. Uvek je dobro znati nekoga u bolnici u kojoj se&amp;nbsp;prijavljujete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da li uopšte vredi dolaziti ovde, kada ima toliko problema sa primenom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt;?&amp;nbsp;Apsolutno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:kartice"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To su obično suve činjenie do kojih ne možete brzo doći povezivanjem stvari koje već znate. Ako ste imalo pazili na faksu, to nikako ne bi trebalo da bude &lt;em&gt;ceo First Aid&lt;/em&gt;, pošto bi dobar deo tih činjenica trebalo da vam je već ugraviran u pamćenje.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:kartice" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:mmrs"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Najbolji primer za ovo je mikrobiologija i Microbiology Made Ridiculously Simple. Čitajte samo o onim organizmima koji se nalaze i u First Aid-u, što je manje od pola knjige.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:mmrs" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:tablet"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iako su Apple uređaji bolji izbor za lekare, u Srbiji su i dalje preskupi i nedovoljno podržani.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:tablet" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:skor"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naravno, efektivni minimum za strance je i dalje oko 220 ± 10.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:skor" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:intervjui"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ove godine i ja intervjuišem gomilu kandidata. Više o tome čim se završi ceo proces, sredinom marta.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:intervjui" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

I like to think I&amp;#8217;m a semi-advanced user, so for some of them I have also listed simpler alternatives. It goes without saying that you should download all the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/creativity-apps/ios/"&gt;free iWork and iLife apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medicine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MKSAP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: all medicine&amp;nbsp;residents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free (if you bought online &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MKSAP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;access)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MKSAP&lt;/span&gt; question bank. No-brainer if you are studying for your internal medicine board or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOC&lt;/span&gt; exam. Less page-flipping and instant gratification. Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to highlighting or annotate the explanations. Also, it can&amp;#8217;t make custom quizzes, can&amp;#8217;t review unanswered/wrong questions, and doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you to copy any of the text to your notes. Lot&amp;#8217;s of cants, but it&amp;#8217;s the only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MKSAP&lt;/span&gt; app available. Free if you purchase the electronic version of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MKSAP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mksap-16/id580511525?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MKSAP&lt;/span&gt; 16 from the app store&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: all&amp;nbsp;interns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: ok, sort&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like a good idea, and the content is great, but it is more of a branded &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; reader than anything else. Doesn&amp;#8217;t have search or favorites, and you have to download each recommendation one by one. The download is fast, but good luck getting what you need without internet access. So, good for night-time reading, particularly if you&amp;#8217;re an intern, but not a good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acp-clinical-guidelines/id618318388?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACP&lt;/span&gt; Guidelines from the app store&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stanford&amp;nbsp;25&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For:&amp;nbsp;everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t heard of Stanford 25 before, see &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/abraham_verghese_a_doctor_s_touch.html"&gt;this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt; talk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://stanford25blog.stanford.edu"&gt;see the blog&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s another good, if ugly, night table&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stanford-medicine-25/id556453964?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Stanford 25 from the app store&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things for iPad (or&amp;nbsp;Omnifocus)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For:&amp;nbsp;everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $19.99 for Things, $39.99 for&amp;nbsp;OmniFocus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#8217;re a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; fan or not, this or it&amp;#8217;s more powerful and more expensive sibling &lt;a href="http://macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; are a must-have for anyone shuffling between more than two areas of responsibility. It still hasn&amp;#8217;t been updated for iOS 7, but is very functional. Only two missing features for me, really: there are no nested tasks/dependencies, and you can&amp;#8217;t filter by more than one&amp;nbsp;tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about switching to OmniFocus, but this works well enough for me that the hassle of complete overhauling my system wouldn&amp;#8217;t be worth it. Not to mention the &amp;gt;100$ price&amp;nbsp;tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-for-ipad/id364365411?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Things for iPad from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-for-ipad/id383804552?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;You can find OmniFocus for iPad&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boxer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone who gets more than 5&amp;nbsp;emails/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$0.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best mail client on the iPad. Apple&amp;#8217;s Mail.app was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; until I realized I spent way too much time scrolling through my list of 20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; folders whenever I wanted to move an email. Boxer works with Gmail, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; and Exchange accounts, has smart email sorting, and integrates with &lt;a href="http://www.sanebox.com"&gt;Sanebox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boxer-for-gmail-outlook-exchange/id561712083?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Boxer&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For:&amp;nbsp;everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Dropbox on your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;—and you must—then this is a&amp;nbsp;no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Dropbox for iOS from the app store&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iThoughts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For:&amp;nbsp;nerds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $9.99 for&amp;nbsp;either&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.tonybuzan.com/about/mind-mapping/"&gt;Tony Buzan&amp;#8217;s book on mind mapping&lt;/a&gt; as a first-year medical student and used the hell out of it for my biophysics, chemistry and genetics coursers. As the material got more complicated, shuffling huge stacks of A3 paper became unwieldy, so I went back to plain old Cornell notes for biochemistry et al. This app is what got me back to making maps, this time when writing review articles and planning out other research. Also good when contemplating the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTD&lt;/span&gt; 50,000 ft&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughtshd-mindmapping/id369020033?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download iThoughts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; for iPad from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#8217;s prettier new cousin &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindnode/id312220102?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Mindnode 3 is available&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calendars&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: all busy&amp;nbsp;overachievers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$6.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default calendar used to be ugly and impractical. With iOS 7 it&amp;#8217;s just the latter. This is a good replacement. Fantastical for iPad would be nice,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Calendars 5 from the app store&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drafts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: advanced&amp;nbsp;users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$3.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick note-taking and automation rolled into one. I use it as the default inbox for anything and everything, mainly by appending a dump.txt file in my Dropbox. There is a separate iPhone version that is just as&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pinner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For:&amp;nbsp;pack-rats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$1.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pinboard.in"&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent almost-free bookmarking and discovery service. There are plenty of iPad clients available, but Pinner seemed to be the most cost-effective. I haven&amp;#8217;t regretted the&amp;nbsp;purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: anyone who is forced to use&amp;nbsp;GroupWise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;meh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$9.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to use GroupWise email for work. This is the only decent client I found for iOS. Stopped looking for a replacement since my last day of residency is less than six months&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds since the days of Bloglines (circa 2001) and switched to Google reader after the first big redesign. It&amp;#8217;s sad that Google decided to murder it instead developing its potential as a social service. &lt;a href="https://feedwrangler.net/"&gt;Feed wrangler&lt;/a&gt; is a good replacement, &lt;a href="http://feedly.com/index.html#welcome"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; is a free one. Reeder 2 is the best iPad feed reader there is, and works well with&amp;nbsp;both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Instapaper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone who&amp;nbsp;reads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$3.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read any text that&amp;#8217;s longer than 500 words with any regularity, you need a service that will keep track of the articles and remove all the annoying cruft surrounding the text. &lt;a href="http://www.instapaper.com/"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; is the first one of its kind, and the best way to read articles on it is on an&amp;nbsp;iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Instapaper for iOS from the app store&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten good articles hand-picked by an expert hand-picker and delivered (almost) every weekday. My only source of news for the past six&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book from Tony Buzan that I read was on speed reading. This app will flash words from any article you find online or in your Instapaper/Pocket queue one-by-one at a set rate. Good for those who are too lazy to&amp;nbsp;swipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For:&amp;nbsp;everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journaling app. I don&amp;#8217;t use it for the Dear-Diary types of texts—though I have no doubt it would be perfect for that. Instead, I use it to keep an archive of meeting and lecture notes (usually started in Drafts and sent to Day One), with an occasional milestone in between. Feature request: multiple&amp;nbsp;journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a long text on an iPad and don&amp;#8217;t need automation, text expansion et al. then this is the app for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Byword for iOS from the app store&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editorial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: advanced&amp;nbsp;users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a long text on an iPad and like mucking about with workflows, text snippets and Python scripts—which I most certainly do—this is your only choice on any platform. This will become essential next July when I start my long&amp;nbsp;commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Social&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Twitterific  5 or&amp;nbsp;Tweetbot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For:&amp;nbsp;everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: meh… you might want to wait for the newest version of Tweetbot to come&amp;nbsp;out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $2.99 for Twitterrific, $2.99 for&amp;nbsp;Tweetbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are on Twitter—and if you are a physician &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/04/twitter-doctors-guide-health-care-professionals.html"&gt;you really should be&lt;/a&gt;—please get a decent iOS client. The official one is definitely not it. Tweetbot used to be until iOS 7 came and made it look and feel ancient. Twitterrific is a good—if slightly annoying—substitute, with the added benefit of being universal (i.e. iPhone and iPad with the same purchase). I&amp;#8217;m using the old version of Tweetbot and waiting for the new one, since Twitterific tended to make a mess of my position in the&amp;nbsp;stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-5-for-twitter/id580311103?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Twitterrific 5 here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter-ipad/id498801050?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Tweetbot for iPad&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone who uses Facebook&amp;nbsp;(why?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: my wife likes&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I guess, if you&amp;#8217;re into that sort of&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For: everyone away from&amp;nbsp;family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the international default for long-distance communication, I guess. It gets choppy and drains the battery, but it&amp;#8217;s the only thing my mom knows how to use so I&amp;#8217;m stuck with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;For: everyone who can&amp;nbsp;spell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free (with in-app&amp;nbsp;purchase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent turn-based word game. The only multiplayer game I play with any regularity. You need an in-app purchase if you want to play more than two games at the same time, but it&amp;#8217;s well worth it. I have five going on right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;$4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2D side-scrolling action-adventure game set under the sea. At my pace I will finish it in about two years, but it&amp;#8217;s great even in 15-minute&amp;nbsp;increments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aquaria/id469372252?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Aquaria for iOS&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward an email containing a tracking number to a special email address. &lt;em&gt;Boom&lt;/em&gt;, you can now track your package through this app, with push notifications if you&amp;#8217;re into being interrupted whenever a case of -diapers- Wild Turkey is delivered to your front&amp;nbsp;door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good app for ordering food in the Baltimore area. Don&amp;#8217;t know about rest of the&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Recommendation:&amp;nbsp;strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free (you pay for the plane ticket,&amp;nbsp;though)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best flight comparison engine there is. Find the most affordable and least annoying plane route. Also does hotel rooms, which I haven&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;tried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Price:&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used this app exactly once, to watch a couple of episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer while waiting for an Amtrak train. Well worth it,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have my original remote any more. We assume Dora ate it. This app is even better, since you don&amp;#8217;t have to muck around with the tiny remote buttons when entering your wifi password or searching&amp;nbsp;Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

Nije mogla da spava—zubi, valjda—pa sam je sinoć oko 11 smestio kod sebe u krevet. Ivana se tada još nije bila vratila sa posla, a kada smo se probudili već je bila otišla. Tako to ide sa&amp;nbsp;dežurstvima.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skajp uz doručak. Dora demonstrira svoj novostečeni ataksični hod (pra)bakama i dekama. Između poziva bacim pogled na Blic: imovinske karte ministara. Toma Jovanović je ministar?! Pre devet godina polagao sam kod njega fiziologiju. Ispit sam spremao četiri meseca. Posle pet minuta: &lt;em&gt;Može devet?&lt;/em&gt; Može! Više vremena je proveo pričajući o tome kako je upoznao svoju suprugu. I ona je kod njega odgovarala, ako se dobro&amp;nbsp;sećam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toma Jovanović je ministar?&amp;nbsp;Prosvete?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idemo u šetnju parkom, na hibridnom trotinetu/kolicima, poklon od strica. Stric sad radi u Roterdamu. Otišao je kad je izgubio posao—ili je beše dao ostavku?—u Novom Sadu. U parku se sprema neko venčanje. Na jednom od travnjaka razapet šator. Izlaze dve devojke u&amp;nbsp;sariju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dora je posle šetnje umorna. Dok drema instaliram kapiju za stepenište, dečije brave za fioke i ormariće. Ne sećam se da su moji roditelji to nameštali kad smo brat i ja prohodali. Opet, na sudskoj smo pričali koliko je kod nas skučajeva dece koja gutaju kaustične&amp;nbsp;rastvore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nismo imali ni sedište za auto. Doduše, nismo imali ni auto dok nisam napunio 8-9&amp;nbsp;godina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad imam auto koji sam plato manje od iPad-a na kome ovo kucam. Mobilni telefon mi čita otisak prsta. Od kuće mogu da pogledam &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; pacijenta koji sam naručio pre manje od 12&amp;nbsp;sati.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nego, peti oktobar. &lt;a href="http://www.rasakarapandza.com/random/?p=151"&gt;Ovo je najbolji tekst koji ćete o tome pročitati&lt;/a&gt;. Ako još uvek imate sumnji, zamislite svet u kome se 11. septembar desio pre 5.&amp;nbsp;oktobra.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Oct 2013 17:26:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2013-10-05:/srb/2013/10/05/peti-oktobar-2013/</guid></item><item><title>Šta se dešava u Vašingtonu</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2013/10/02/sta-se-desava-u-vasingtonu/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Napomena: američku političku scenu pratim koliko i kriket—znam šta je, čujem kolege kako pričaju o tome, i vidim poneki prilog na &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;-u, jedinom kanalu na &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;-u u lekarskoj&amp;nbsp;prostoriji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republikanci su se preračunali. Obamaker&lt;sup id="fnref:ACA"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ACA" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; je izglasan dva puta—jednom u Kongresu, drugi put kada je Obama dobio drugi mandat a demokrate povećale većinu u Senatu. Sada misle da državnu upravu mogu držati kao taoca, dok se ne desi šta? Obama odloži sprovođenje zakona na godinu dana? Ha ha&amp;nbsp;ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valjda su se nadali da će novo individualno zdravstveno osiguranje biti spektakularan promašaj, i da će desetine miliona razočaranih i još uvek neosiguranih Amerikanaca vilama i bakljama krenuti na Belu kuću. Onda bi Bejner, Rajan i Bahmanova&lt;sup id="fnref:gop"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gop" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; zajedno stali pred mikrofon i rekli &lt;em&gt;U-ta-ta&lt;/em&gt; dok se demokrate ritualno samo-spaljuju isped&amp;nbsp;Kapitola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na njihovu žalost, &lt;em&gt;nešto&lt;/em&gt; je u glavama ljudi uvek bolje nego &lt;em&gt;ništa&lt;/em&gt;, vesti su pune naslova o deci sa rakom koja ne mogu da počnu hemoterapiju jer je državni &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIH&lt;/span&gt; zatvoren, tik iznad članaka o siromašnim invalidima koji prvi put posle 20 godina mogu da se osiguraju, a utisak koji republikanci sami potvrđuju je da su baš oni odgovorni za zatvaranje federalnih ustanova kako bi zaštitili zemlju od zlog i nedopečenog&amp;nbsp;Obamakera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bejner verovatno proklinje dan kada su braća Koch rešila da sponzorišu/oforme ultra-desne &lt;em&gt;Tea Party&lt;/em&gt; republikance. Za par dana ili nedelja skupiće dovoljno umerenih republikanskih kongresmena da se odblokira budžet i podigne granicu zaduživanja, i možda dobiti neki minimalni ustupak u vidu ukidanja nekog minornog poreza na medicinsku opremu. Obama 3, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:ACA"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affordable Care Act—&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACA&lt;/span&gt;—je zakon koji, između ostalog, propisuje obavezno zdravstveno osiguranje za sve Amerikance. Onima koji do sada nisu mogli da ga dobiju, jer im ga poslodavac ne omogućuje a suviše su mladi za državno osiguranje i suviše bolesni za individualno privatno, obezbeđene su povoljne polise koje delom subvencioniše federalna vlada a delom pojedinačne države. Što se mene kao interniste i budućeg onkologa tiče, ovo je sjajno. Više osiguranih znači manje glavobolja za nas i pacijente, manje uplakanih morbidno gojaznih sredovečnih žena koje ne mogu da priušte zamenu kolena, i možda malo više posla za socijalne radnike koji će sada umesto sleganja ramenima moći da pomognu ljudima da nađu kakvo-takvo osiguranje.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ACA" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nominally, the lecture was about &lt;em&gt;RVUs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:rvu"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rvu" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An accountant type in a pinstripe suit explained why the government came up with the concept and how more RVUs translate to mo&amp;#8217; money for the hospital. Then he showed us a table. This is how much RVUs an average ophthalmologist makes in an hour. Here is an orthopedic surgeon. See here at the bottom? That&amp;#8217;s an internist. &lt;em&gt;This is how much you&amp;#8217;re worth to us, scum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:words"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:words" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was a chart. This is the last fiscal year. This solid line here are monthly RVUs for an average hospitalist. The dotted line is for a single physician in the practice. See how it&amp;#8217;s always above the solid line? That&amp;#8217;s good. &lt;em&gt;We love that person&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had medical students and interns just three months into training listen to this. It was&amp;nbsp;blood-curdling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not because the hospital organized the lecture, mind you. It is a very good thing they did it, and it is good for doctors in training to realize as early as possible in what kind of a healtcare system they are expected to work. What is frightening is that there needs to be an entity, let&amp;#8217;s call it &lt;em&gt;administration&lt;/em&gt;, which views the hospital as a production plant and physicians as line workers who need to &lt;em&gt;maximize outputs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;optimize efficiencies&lt;/em&gt; and do other newspeak&amp;nbsp;claptrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administration usually lies—appropriately—on the ground floor, far removed from that other sausage factory of actual patient care. It looks at pie charts and histograms and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RVU&lt;/span&gt; tables and keeps coming up with new and exciting ways to increase production while wondering why those bumbling doctors at the bottom of the list can&amp;#8217;t do whatever the top performing docs are doing to keep the hospital in the&amp;nbsp;black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s modern medicine, it&amp;#8217;s complex, it&amp;#8217;s expensive, it requires that level of organization and detachment—you might be tempted to say. Yes, you could indeed say that, if not for the lonely example of &lt;em&gt;every other country in the developed world&lt;/em&gt; which does it differently than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never mind that. With all the shenanigans the Congress has been up to this week, that end of the equation is unlikely to change. What administrators should do—and I understand the banality of the following advice—is see real physicians interacting with real patients for at least and hour each week. Interns being bombarded by page after page—from critical to comical—while trying to figure out a 15-minute window to eat, get coffee and use the restroom&lt;sup id="fnref:wc"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wc" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Residents finishing a 24+ hour &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICU&lt;/span&gt; shift that started with three codes and ended with a difficult end-of-life care discussion, with central lines placements and intern supervision—but no sleep—sprinkled in between. Attendings getting yelled at while trying to explain to family members why they need to pay for the medications out of pocket or bring their own&lt;sup id="fnref:obs"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:obs" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hour. Each week. Mandatory. To put things in&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2013 15:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2013-09-24:/eng/2013/09/24/on-rvus-sort-of/</guid></item><item><title>On patient notes and busy interns</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/09/15/on-patient-notes-and-busy-interns/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Electronic patient notes, the way they stand now, are dangerous. As physicians wiser and more experienced than myself have noted, they are made for billing, not story-telling and communication between healthcare professionals; and as anyone with even basic literacy in the English language will notice as soon as they read one, they are a barely comprehensible, intelligible, muddled word salad that looks computer generated because, well, in most cases it&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, they are ridiculously easy to create. Click on a checkbox and every admission note you start will come pre-populated with what the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; are the patient&amp;#8217;s current home medications, prior surgical procedures and such. Have trouble accurately documenting the dozen medications your 72-year-old with systolic heart failure, diabetes, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CKD&lt;/span&gt; and vascular dementia has? No big deal—the e-patient has at least &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; listed from an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ER&lt;/span&gt; visit 9 months ago. You&amp;#8217;ll make sure to go back to the admission note later and append it with the correct list when you get it from the family member tomorrow, right? &lt;em&gt;Right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also save you from having to type. &lt;em&gt;Click click click&lt;/em&gt;, and the review of systems is done. Too much clicking? There is a solution: spend 5 minutes to create a macro, and you will have all your common questions pre-answered as &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt; on all the notes, shaving of &lt;em&gt;seconds&lt;/em&gt; of additional clicking. Because asking all your patients the same questions and expecting identical answers is just plain common sense, amiright? Oh, and of course tachycardia is a symptom. It&amp;#8217;s right there on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROS&lt;/span&gt; list, waiting to be&amp;nbsp;clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, electronic notes are the one cure for writer&amp;#8217;s block. While in the distant past&lt;sup id="fnref:sinainotes"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sinainotes" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; you had to spend agonizing minutes staring at a blank admission note trying to form a coherent story on why the patient came to be seen, and then try putting it down on paper down without feeling ashamed, you learn from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMR&lt;/span&gt; that it is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to sign a medico-legal document that contains this brilliant turn of&amp;nbsp;phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for visit is: pt missed hd, high bp, n/v. The course was: constant. The exacerbating factor was: none. The alleviating factor was:&amp;nbsp;none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;? Medicine residents are, in general, all moderately-to-ridiculosuly smart and ambitious people who should know&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, some of them don&amp;#8217;t. Even in the olden days&lt;sup id="fnref2:sinainotes"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sinainotes" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; you had a couple of interns who weren&amp;#8217;t the best ever history-takers&lt;sup id="fnref:historians"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:historians" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and wrote poor-quality notes. Electronic notes, unfortunately, help them obfuscate their deficiencies. It is very easy to see in a one-page note how much useful information the resident has actually obtained. Not so much with computer-generated&amp;nbsp;six-pagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is your typical smart intern just finishing putting in orders for her fourth admission admission that day after discussing each one with the supervising resident, all while answering a barrage of pages about the 30 patients she is cross-covering. The first two admission notes are almost done—she has to updated the plan after talking with the resident—but the other two will have to wait until she updates the sign-out and hands off all the patients to the night float. This is arguably much more important than notes as it directly affects the care those newly admitted patients will get overnight, while the admission note is not really needed until the following day during morning rounds. She&amp;#8217;s smart enough to&amp;nbsp;prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#8217;s also smart enough to know what is expected of her. What she know about writing admission notes during residency she learned from her peers, particularly seniors—who concentrated on &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt; —and that lady at the billing department who gave a noon conference talk on the importance of &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; documentation for coding. So The Man wants me to be efficient-yet-thorough, and then he gives me this electronic tool with auto-population, templates, macros and such. &lt;em&gt;Hmmmmm&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, she might get in trouble if her notes are so horrendously bad to significantly impede patient care. From my very limited experience this just does not happen. Or rather, if it does, appropriate documentation is a single bullet in the long list of areas of improvement during an&amp;nbsp;M&amp;amp;M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:sinainotes"&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:historians"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would be the ones calling the patient &amp;#8220;a poor historian&amp;#8221;, and were usually correct, although not in the way they intended. Patients are the ones giving a (hi)story, the &lt;em&gt;physician&lt;/em&gt; is the historian.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:historians" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Suvi,&amp;nbsp;nezavejani.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juče je izgledalo kao da će biti šest metara snega, i da ćemo po drugi put u šest meseci ostati zatvoreni u bolnici zbog lošeg vremena. Tačnije, tako se činilo svakome ko je gledao &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, kao jedan od naših šefova koji je na posao došao u 3 ujutru da bi stigao pre mećave. Sledeća četiri sata nakon toga proveo je u čišćenju kancelarije, a nakon posla je uredno otišao kući kolima kao i svi&amp;nbsp;ostali.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bolnica je pretila da će proglasiti još jedan &lt;em&gt;code yellow&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;-naredbu svim zaposlenima u bolnici da ne izlaze, i svima koji tek treba da dođu na posao da sačekaju da prevoz dođe po njih. Otkazali su kliniku i nastavu za studente. Rekli su nam da ponesemo zalihe za slučaj da moramo da&amp;nbsp;prenoćimo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na kraju se nije desilo ništa. Sneg je padao par sati pa se otopio kao da ga nije ni bilo, nije se čuo &lt;em&gt;code yellow&lt;/em&gt;, a vreme danas je pravo prolećno. Tako da, bez&amp;nbsp;brige.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2013 14:57:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2013-03-07:/srb/2013/03/07/sneg/</guid></item><item><title>No more excuses</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/02/27/no-more-excuses/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Finished my last &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICU&lt;/span&gt; rotation today. Life is unpaused.

My native language, Serbian, has no concept of the former thanks to its being phonetic. As for the latter, few people in my home town and the surrounding area cared too much about it, flinging tenses, forms and declinations around carelessly. I proudly continue this&amp;nbsp;tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gets to me is semantics. Misspelling tachypnoeic is unfortunate; saying that the patient&amp;#8217;s head is normocephalic means either that it had grown a head of its own, or that the speaker had no idea what the word they were using signified&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, lots of big words and a sizable footnote just to introduce something I&amp;#8217;ll likely be doing on a weekly basis&amp;#8212;-complaining about today&amp;#8217;s youth and their improper use of medical verbiage&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind that an average internists sees an abnormality like dolichocephaly once every 10 years&amp;#8212;-thus obliviating the need to say that someone&amp;#8217;s head has a normal shape in each and every admission note. Not that most physicians would recognize dolichocephaly if and when they saw it.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets pretend that my entire medical experience thus far does not consist of just over two years of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; residency. Also, English is not my primary language.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bilo bi simpatično da od oktobra ove godine nije postalo direktno vezanu za količinu novca koje Medicaire isplaćuje bolnici za datu uslugu&amp;#8212;-bolnice sa zadovoljnijim pacijentima dobijaju više&amp;nbsp;para.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Šta je tu loše? Pre nekoliko meseci, a dosta godina nakon što je doneta odluka o povezivanju zadovoljstva i isplate, &lt;a href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1108766"&gt;pokazalo se&lt;/a&gt; da su više ocene povezane sa većim brojem hospitalizacija, većim troškovima zdravstvene nege i propisanih lekova, i&amp;#8212;-eto ti ga sad&amp;#8212;-povećanom smrtnošću. Zadovoljni pacijenti su oni koji dobijaju narkotike svaki put kad ih zatraže&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, uspeju da izdiktiraju svojim lekarima kod koga da ih upute i koje sve procedure da izvedu da bi se eliminisala sumnja za postojanje svake moguće bolesti i stanja koje im je &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/07/dr-google-medical-student-google.html"&gt;Dr. Gugl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;izlistao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elem, videh da je danas pušten u rad inspirativno nazvan sajt &lt;a href="http://www.kakavjedoktor.org/"&gt;Kakav je doktor?&lt;/a&gt;. Liči na par &lt;a href="http://www.healthgrades.com/"&gt;američkih&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.ratemds.com/"&gt;uzora&lt;/a&gt;, sa dodatnim naglaskom na korupciju&amp;#8212;-pretpostavljam da je &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; zbog toga odlučio da bude jedan od&amp;nbsp;sponzora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mislim da je ceo koncept gubljenje vremena. Ideja je plemenita, izvedba sasvim korektna, ali glavni korisnici zdravstvenog sistema u Srbiji nisu baš strastveni korisnici Interneta. Pretpostavljam da bi uz ogromnu medijsku kampanju koja bi bila nešto više od priloga u 28. minutu Dnevnika par deka i baka moglo da pita unuke da ocene njihovu finu doktorku u domu zdravlja, ali teško da bi to mogao biti dovoljan uzorak. Sve i da svako oceni svog izabranog lekara&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, područje koje domovi zdravlja obuhvataju obično je dovoljno malo da se u zajednici već zna ko je kakav. O specijalistima se manje zna jer pokrivaju veće područje, ali pacijenti već imaju dovoljno problema da dobiju uput za ustanovu koju žele&amp;#8212;-izbor specijaliste je za većinu mislena&amp;nbsp;imenica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Čak i ovde, gde je uz pristojno osiguranje sasvim moguće ići direktno izabranom specijalisti bez ikakvog uputa, i gde se na Internetu ocenjuju svi, od stolara do gradonačelnika, pitanje ovakvo direktnog i otvorenog ocenjivanja lekara je &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/your-money/why-the-web-lacks-authoritative-reviews-of-doctors.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;kontroverzna tema&lt;/a&gt;. Izgleda da je situacija slična &lt;a href="http://www.worldcrunch.com/culture-society/the-pluses-and-perils-of-patients-grading-doctors-on-the-internet/germany-doctors-internet-grades/c3s9542/#.UKlYGeSRR2A"&gt;i u Nemačkoj&lt;/a&gt;. Na žalost ili sreću, mislim da u Srbiji ima još manje šansi da&amp;nbsp;zaživi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostaje mogućnost prijave korupcije kao jedina upotrebljiva funkcija sajta. Pozdravljam, podržavam, i nadam se da će biti u širokoj upotrebi. Bez&amp;nbsp;sarkazma.&lt;/p&gt;

Prvo, &lt;a href="http://markbittman.com/" title="Mark Bittman"&gt;Mark Bitman&lt;/a&gt;, gastronom i kolumnista &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;, o &lt;a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1355685" title="Stanford study"&gt;ovoj meta-analizi&lt;/a&gt; koja kaže da organska hrana nije ništa hranljivija od&amp;nbsp;konvencionalne:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can something that reduces your exposure to pesticides and antibiotic-resistant bacteria not be “more nutritious” than food that&amp;nbsp;doesn’t?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the study narrowly defines “nutritious” as containing more vitamins. Dr. Dena Bravata, the study’s senior author, conceded that there are other reasons why people opt for organic (the aforementioned pesticides and bacteria chief among them) but said that if the decision between buying organic or conventional food were based on nutrients, “there is not robust evidence to choose one or the other.” By which standard you can claim that, based on nutrients, Frosted Flakes are a better choice than an&amp;nbsp;apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hana Kazanović a.k.a. Cyber Bosanka, o bosanskim ekvivalentima Frosted&amp;nbsp;Flejksa:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U principu smatram da sve što je nastalo u laboratoriji nije zdravo za jelo, a posebno da nije preporučljivo za djecu koja rastu i razvijaju se. Slatkiš je zaista presladak (tu sam se složila sa Draganom nakon što sam ga probala) i ne obiluje zdravim sastojcima. Garantujem da svako od nas u kuhinji može napraviti puno zdraviji i ukusniji kolač za dijete, od prirodnih&amp;nbsp;sastojaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href="http://www.bosanka.net/slatkisi-koji-se-reklamiraju-na-sve-strane-najcesce-i-nisu-bas-zdravi-kako-djecu-sacuvati-od-njih/#more-4652"&gt;Slatkiši koji se reklamiraju na sve strane najčešće i nisu baš zdravi. Kako djecu sačuvati od njih? | Cyber Bosanka - Hana Kazazović&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oboje izgleda jako drže do &lt;em&gt;prirodne&lt;/em&gt; i &lt;em&gt;zdrave&lt;/em&gt; hrane&amp;#8212;dva efemerna pojma koja u glavama ljudi obično idu ruku pod ruku i za koje će svako lako dati primere&amp;#8212;spanać je i prirodan i zdrav, Tviks nije ni jedno od ta dva. Osim, naravno, za dijabetičara u hipoglikemijskoj krizi koji je na varfarinu zbog atrijalne fibrilacije&amp;#8212;sav taj šećer u Tviksu će itekako pomoći, vitamin K u spanaću koji poništava dejstvo varfarina baš i neće. Ili, još jednostavnije: šta biste od ta dva preporučili nekome ko je gladan i &lt;em&gt;alergičan na spanać&lt;/em&gt;. Pojam &lt;em&gt;zdrave hrane&lt;/em&gt; je, kao i skoro sve drugo u medicini, potpuno&amp;nbsp;relativan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretpostavka je onda da većina ljudi pod pojmom &amp;#8220;zdrava&amp;#8221; podrazumeva hranu sa što više vitamina i minerala, a što manje kalorija i, naravno, bez stvari za koje se zna da izazivaju ili doprinose bolesti&amp;#8212;pesticida, antibiotika, dokazanih kancerogena&amp;#8230; Ono što je Bitmana pogodilo a što je stanfordka studija pokazala je da se po prvoj stavci, količini hranljivih materija, organska hrana ne razlikuje od konvencionalne. Ova druga, odsustvo štetnih materija, nije&amp;nbsp;proveravana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iskaču dva pitanja: da li materije koje u laboratoriji date u mega-dozama mogu sa izazovu rak kod, recimo, pacova, smeju da se nađu u ljudskoj ishrani; i da li možemo biti 100% sigurni da su baš svi sastojci propisno ispitani? Za oba je ključno poverenje, u nauku uopšte koja kaže da je život sam po sebi kancerogen i da je sve pitanje količine i umerenosti pa daje maksimalno dozvoljene koncentracije; u proizvođače koji garantuju da je ono što je na etiketi zaista i u pakovanju; u državnu regulativu i konkretnu laboratoriju koja treba da ispita dati uzorak hrane na ispravnost. Nešto mi govori na to nije ono o čemu su Bitman i Sajber Bosanka prvenstveno&amp;nbsp;mislili.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biće da je ključ u onome &lt;em&gt;prirodno&lt;/em&gt;. Prirodnost hrane je za većinu ljudi, pretpostavljam, njena blizina primarnom, neobrađenom obliku. Jednostavno je utvrditi da su voće, povrće i neobrađeno meso &lt;em&gt;prirodni&lt;/em&gt;, a Snikers i Smoki ne. Naravno, u pitanju je kontinuum&amp;#8212;Pringles čips je većini manje prirodan od Čipsija sa ukusom pice&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a ovaj opet manje prirodan od običnog slanog. Gde će neko datu hranu postaviti na taj kontinuum je, međutim, subjektivno i zavisi od njegove/njene upoznatosti za procesom prerade&amp;#8212;pšenično brašno je nama verovatno prirodnije od &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapioca" title="Tapioca - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;tapioke&lt;/a&gt;, ali ne i nekome iz dubine&amp;nbsp;Amazona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savremena prehrambena industrija i način na koji pripremaju hranu i obeležavaju sastojke dodatno udaljavaju kornisnika od primarnog izvora. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; je sa svojim &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_number" title="E number - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;&amp;#8220;E brojevima&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; dodatno zakomplikovala stvar i dala novu zanimaciju teoretičarima zavere&amp;#8212;svako zna za ljutu papriku, neko zna da je ljutina u njoj od kapseicina, ali šta je kog đavola &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E160c" title="Paprika oleoresin - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;E160c&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Šta onda kupovati? Možete se držati onog Polanovog: &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0" title="Unhappy Meals - Michael Pollan - New York Times"&gt;&amp;#8220;Jedite hranu. Ne previše. Uglavnom biljke.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; gde pod &amp;#8220;hranom&amp;#8221; podrazumeva nimalo ili minimalno procesuirane proizvode&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ali isključivo da biste sebi uštedeli vreme pri kupovini a ne kao garanciju &lt;em&gt;prirodnosti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; i &lt;em&gt;zdravlja&lt;/em&gt;. Neko može pratiti njegova pravila i završiti samo na nutrijensima-siromašnom krompiru i pirinču, dok dosta prerađene hrane na kojoj smo odrasli (Plazma keks) ne bi bilo obuhvaćeno iako sadrži sasvim dovoljno vitamina i minerala. Ova pravila su zgodna heuristika za brzo biranje (verovatno) dobre hrane sa minimalnim rizikom od izlaganja nepoznatim i/ili potencijalno štetnim materijama, ali nisu nikakva garancija zdravlja i kvaliteta. Jer i pored svih vaših najboljih namera, onaj skroz domaći kolač koji ste kod kuće napravili od organskog belog brašna, domaćih jaja, organskog bezmesnog mleka bez antibiotika i hormona rasta, i prirodnog šećera od trske sa male &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairtrade_certification" title="Fairtrade certification - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;Fertrejd&lt;/a&gt; plantaže na Ekvadoru&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; imaće jednaku nutricionističku (bez)vrednost kao Barni čokoladica&lt;sup id="fnref:5"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kad smo kod toga: šta je kog đavola ukus pice?! Različiti proizvođači stavljaju drugačije stvari, ali im je nešto zajedničko&amp;#8212;preslano, sa naznakama paradajza i origana.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dobro pravilo je ne više od pet izlistanih sastojaka na kutiji, ako uopšte morate da kupite nešto što dolazi u pakovanju.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Još jedna stvar sa tim &amp;#8220;prirodnim&amp;#8221;: gde smestiti med? Po čemu su to pčele specijalne da je ono što one naprave prirodno, a što naprave ljudi nije. Da li su mravinjaci i ptičja gnezda prirodne ili veštačke tvorevine? Da li su ljudi deo prirode ili ne, jer ako jesu onda su i sve stvari koje proizvedu&amp;#8212;prirodne.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali, budimo realni, da li je &lt;em&gt;vaša&lt;/em&gt; mama toliko vodila računa o sastojcima kad vam je pravila domaće galete.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neko bi rekao: da, ali bar ne zadrži &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-fructose_corn_syrup" title="High-fructose corn syrup - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HFCS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ili u bosanskoj varijanti, izgleda, glukozo-fruktozni sirup).

&lt;p&gt;Za kontinuiranu edukaciju svaka pristojna zdravstvena ustanova održava nedeljna predavanja. Manje bolnice i privatne prakse šalju ljude na lokalne 2-3 časovne putujuće seminare u organizaciji strukovnih udruženja, ili se jednostavno &lt;a href="http://www.medscape.org/" title="Medscape Education (CME and Other Learning Activities)"&gt;uloguju na Medskejp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad, informacije koje se tamo dobiju nisu uvek najsvežije. Donedavno, svako ko nije imao vremena i/ili para da izlista svih &lt;a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=big%20five%20medicine%20journals+site:www.hello.nhs.uk" title="big five medicine journals site:www.hello.nhs.uk at DuckDuckGo"&gt;pet velikih časopisa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;-znači svi&amp;#8212;-imao je dve opcije: da ode na kongres, ili na &amp;#8220;edukativni&amp;#8221; ručak/večeru, oba finansijski podržana od strane farmaceutskih kuća. Kome nije do svega onog što veliki kongres podrazumeva, a što je Ivan naveo u svom blogu, bira besplatan ručak. Koji, naravno, nikako nije besplatan jer vam predstavnici &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865478007?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=Bad%20pharma&amp;amp;qid=1349546445&amp;amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;amp;sr=8-1" title="Bad Pharma: How Drug Companies Mislead Doctors and Harm Patients: Ben Goldacre: 9780865478008: Amazon.com: Books"&gt;Velike Farme&lt;/a&gt; dobrim delom serviraju, hm, &lt;em&gt;poluistine&lt;/em&gt;. Čak i na dobro organizovanim &lt;em&gt;pharma free&lt;/em&gt; kongresima postoje manje ili više dobronamerni istraživači željni da predstave preliminarne rezultate koji nikada neće biti objavljeni. Ili, kako je to rekao jedan pametan Grk&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large professional meetings, as they are currently run, may really be the best there is in modern medicine—as many sales departments of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry and most hotel managers would argue. However, if there is uncertainty and equipoise about the utility or lack thereof of medical congresses, it may be time to perform formal studies to assess what types of meetings or other methods for research dissemination and education work best in training excellent physicians, improving medical care, and controlling cost. The next step probably would be to randomize the first&amp;nbsp;meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We found that 60% said they would retire today if given the opportunity. What was worrisome is that this is up from 45% in 2008,&amp;#8221; Walker says. &amp;#8220;We also know from the survey that we disaggregated it into certain categories, 47% of physicians under 40 said they would retire today if given the&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with a probability-based sample of 3442 working &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; adults, physicians were more likely to have symptoms of burnout (37.9% vs 27.8%) and to be dissatisfied with work-life balance (40.2% vs 23.2%) (P &amp;lt; .001 for both). Highest level of education completed also related to burnout in a pooled multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, relationship status, and hours worked per&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prvi članak je komentar na &lt;a href="http://www.physiciansfoundation.org/uploads/default/Physicians_Foundation_2012_Biennial_Survey.pdf" title="PDF"&gt;ovu anketu&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) preko 13.000 lekara. Deo o zadovoljstvu i moralu počinje na 18. strani. Najzanimljivije&amp;nbsp;stavke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;58% svoj moral ocenjuje kao donekle ili vrlo negativan; 80% ih misli da su im kolege&amp;nbsp;takve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre četiri godine, 73% bi ponovo izabrali istu profesiju; ove&amp;nbsp;godine&amp;#8212;-66%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doduše, 42% bi medicinu preporučili svojoj ili deci prijatelja&amp;#8212;-2% više nego&amp;nbsp;2008.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meni najbliže srcu: 60% lekara bi odmah u penziju, da mogu; 2008. to je htelo&amp;nbsp;45%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kad se rezultati podele prema uzrastu i polu, najveći pesimisti bili su muškarci stariji od&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Najčešće navedeni negativan faktor bio je strah od tužbi koji tera na defanzivnu medicinu. U top pet bili su još problemi sa naplatom i državnom regulativom&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ludačko radno vreme, i nemedicinska papirologija&amp;#8212;-triplet koji se svodi na jedan suštinski problem: da biste od državnog osiguranja&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; dobili bilo kakvu nadoknadu morati popuniti gomilu formulara, ili sami, ili nekoga da platite. U svakom slučaju, duže ste na&amp;nbsp;poslu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ništa od ovog me previše ne dotiče, kao ni bilo koga ko je još uvek na specijalizaciji. Naplatom se ne bavimo, o tužbama ne razmišljamo pošto su za nas još uvek odgovorni nadređeni, a sa radnim vremenom znate koliko je sati kad je skraćenje na &lt;em&gt;80 sati nedeljno&lt;/em&gt; od pre 7-8 godina bilo dočekano sa oduševljenjem. Kad se školovanje završi, najmanje zadovoljni biće oni koji su (sub)specijalizaciju birali prvenstveno prema očekivanim prihodima&amp;#8212;-uglavnom Amerikanci sa ogromnim dugovima koje treba vratiti. Na stranu ono da treba stvarno &lt;em&gt;voleti&lt;/em&gt; svoj posao ako se isti sastoji iz 50 rektalnih tušea na dan&amp;#8212;-tarifa za svaku proceduru se menja svakih par godina, a ne određuju je lekari već osiguravajuće kuće. Ako vam je poslovna strategija to da odradite bar tri kateteriazacije dnevno da biste ostali u crnom, pa vam Medicare svojim novim cenovnikom smanji prihod za trećinu, počećete da stavljate stentove i tamo gde ne&amp;nbsp;treba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zašto su žene i omladina zadovoljniji, ili pre&amp;#8212;-&lt;em&gt;manje nezadovoljni&lt;/em&gt;? Pretpostavljam zato što više njih radi sa skraćenim radnim vremenom, na smenu, i za drugog&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, što sve jako podseća na&amp;#8212;-specijalizaciju (osim onog dela o skraćenom radnom vremenu). Ono što bih ja hteo&amp;#8212;-onkologija u nekoj univerzitetskoj bolnici&amp;#8212;-je baš to, sa dodatnim bonusom da vreme mogu da podelim između klinike i laboratorije. Istina, za značajno manje para, ali bože moj. Bitna razlika između nezadovoljnih, razočaranih, o-samoubistvu-razmišljajućih starijih doktora i ostalih je mesto koje novčana kompenzacija ima na listi&amp;nbsp;prioriteta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tu je uvek i &lt;a href="http://www.imrmedical.com/whyaustralianz.htm" title="Why Australia or New Zealand?"&gt;Novi Zeland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sa dva kraja: ko zarađuje na procedurama misli da nije plaćen dovoljno, ko ne radi procedure žali se što ne može da naplati onih 45 minuta provedenih u ubeđivanju morbidno gojaznog dijabetičara koji se oporavlja od šloga da prestane da puši; i jedni i drugi bi se sa osiguravajućim kućama najradije obračunali &lt;a href="http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=XkUaV9GZDuk&amp;amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXkUaV9GZDuk" title="Fight Club, last scene"&gt;u stilu Tajlera Durdena&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasuprot široko rasprostranjenim zabludama, ovo postoji i bez toga bi devet desetina bolnica, uključujući moju, moglo samo da stavi katanac na vrata. Pogledati Medicare i Medicaid na Vikipediji.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uglavnom bolnicu. Ovo se u Evropi obično podrazumeva, ali je ovde relativno nov koncept pošto je donedavno većina lekara bila samostalna ili radila u malim grupama, i vodila računa o pacijentima gde god oni bili&amp;#8212;-u ordinaciji, kod kuće ili primljeni u bolnicu. Dobro za kontinuitet, ne tako dobro za vaš privatan život ako imate par jako bolesnih pacijenata.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Radi se oko 80 sati nedeljno, dežurstva od 28 sati su svaki treći dan, osim poslednje nedelje kada imam sedam uzastopnih 13-časovnih noćnih, pacijenti nam dolaze na ili jako blizu samrti, i često se pitamo da li ih je dokrajčila bolest ili neka naša intervencija, jer im jako malo treba da krenu&amp;#8212;-ili nastave&amp;#8212;-u pogrešnom&amp;nbsp;smeru&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;i opet bih pre prošao kroz sve to nego da odradim još jedan mesec opšte medicine&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Nema trčanja sa sprata na sprat, nema sestara kojima pet puta moramo da ponovimo šta hoćemo od jutarnjih analiza da bi nas u tri ujutru opet pitali da li smo baš sigurni, nema pacijenata kojima je glavni cilj boravka da vide koliko tačno narkotika mogu da iskamče od neiskusnih stažera. Trči se samo za &lt;a href="http://m.youtube.com/#/watch?v=N8QkwED-zU8"&gt;kodove&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ne više od dva-tri puta nedeljno, sestre uzimaju i &lt;a href="http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/171/18/1646"&gt;više krvi nego što nam treba&lt;/a&gt;, a pacijenti su intubirani, sedirani ili toliko zahvalni što su živi da nemaju nikakvih&amp;nbsp;žalbi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bar misli većina stažista. Ono što se u stvari dešava je ljudska tendencija da prosečan nivo neprijatnosti u određenom vremenskom periodu vidi kao srednju vrednost najveće i poslednje neprijatnosti, a ne kao površinu ispod krive&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Pošto prosečno iskustvo na intenzivnoj u poređenju sa odeljenjem izgleda&amp;nbsp;ovako:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ovde će jednoga dana stajati stari&amp;nbsp;grafikon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nije teško razumeti zašto se ljudima ono što je u proseku mnogo bolnije sviđa više od rotacije sa par jako loših iskustava koju završavate pod pritiskom diktiranja zaostalih otpusnih listi i uputstava za sledećeg stažistu. Kada retroaktivno pokušamo sebi da objasnimo tu diskrepancu, dolazimo do listi kakva je ona u par pasusa iznad, koja izostavlja činjenicu da ste za tih mesec dana intenzivne svoj van-bolnički život sveli na jedno pranje veša, dva-tri odlaska po namirnice i jedan izlazak na kafu sa jednako iscrpljenim sapatnikom iz druge bolnice (pozdrav&amp;nbsp;Vuku).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kako god. U sredu uveče mi je poslednje noćno dežurstvo. U četvrtak se&amp;nbsp;šišam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetics researchers at Washington University, one of the world’s leading centers for work on the human genome, were devastated. Dr. Lukas Wartman, a young, talented and beloved colleague, had the very cancer he had devoted his career to studying. He was deteriorating fast. No known treatment could save him. And no one, to their knowledge, had ever investigated the complete genetic makeup of a cancer like&amp;nbsp;his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Frontiers of Cancer Treatment Bring Breathtaking&amp;nbsp;Swings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. McDaniel, the 69-year-old wife of a retired corporate executive, had gambled on the ultimate in personalized medicine, an approach known as whole genome sequencing, and it seemed to be paying&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists had compared the entire genetic sequences of the tumor cells invading her body with those in her healthy cells, searching for mutated tumor genes that could be thwarted by drugs approved for other cancers or even other diseases. That had led them to give her an expensive drug approved just a month earlier for melanoma patients. It had never been given to anyone with a blood cell cancer like hers. In theory, the drug should have killed her. Instead, it seemed to have halted or even reversed her&amp;nbsp;cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But would it last? And what would it mean if it did&amp;nbsp;not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genetic Test Changes Game in Cancer&amp;nbsp;Prognosis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2011, Cassandra Caton, an 18-year-old with honey-colored hair and the soft features of a child, suddenly went blind in her right eye. Five months later, an ophthalmologist noticed something disturbing. A large growth in the back of her eye had ripped her retina, destroying her&amp;nbsp;vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Iako se do naziva došlo skraćenjem latinskog &lt;em&gt;hemicranium&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;-&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;pola glave&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;, do 40% pacijenata sa migrenama ima bilateralan&amp;nbsp;bol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kako onda znati da li je neka glavobolja migrenozna? Mora da traje 4-72 sata bez terapije; da ima bar dve od sledećih karakteristika: unilateralna, pulsatilna, otežava fizičku aktivnost&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, umerenog do jakog intenziteta; da bude praćena mučninom/povraćanjem i/ili foto- ili fonofobijom. Ko ima pet ili više takvih napada zvanično ima&amp;nbsp;migrene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako vam je to previše komplikovano, sledećih pet karakteristika glavobolje je lakše za pamćenje: pulsatilna, unilateralna, praćena mučninom/povraćanjem/foto/fonofobijom, traje 4-72 sata bez terapije, onemogućava fizičku aktivnost. Ko ima tri od ovih pet karakteristika, i nijedno drugo verovatnije objašnjenje za glavobolju, zaradio je sebi dijagnozu&amp;nbsp;migrene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aura postoji kod oko 20% migrena i traje 4-60 minuta, a glavobolja dolazi do 60 minuta nakon početka aure i traje 4-72&amp;nbsp;sata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Osim klasičnog sevanja pred očima, čudnih mirisa i ostalih audio/vizuelnih doživljaja, aure mogu biti i bazilarne&amp;#8212;-sa vrtolgavicom, nistagmusom, dizartrijom, ataksijom&amp;#8212;-i hemiplegične. Obe vrste, a naročito ova druga, mogu da liče na šlog, ali su potpuno&amp;nbsp;reverzibilne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ko god ima migrenu sa aurom, naročito hemiplegičnom, ima i povećan rizik od pravog šloga, infarkta miokarda i periferne vaskularne bolesti. Zbog tog povećanog rizika žene sa migrenama ne bi trebalo da uzimaju oralne kontraceptive. A ni da&amp;nbsp;puše.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lečenje? Obični ibuprofen i paracetamol mogu lepo da posluže za prekid napada, ako se uzmu dovoljno rano i u dovoljnoj dozi&amp;#8212;-800 mg ibuprofena i/ili ceo gram paracetamola. Ovaj drugi je i jedina stvar koju bi trudnice smele da&amp;nbsp;uzimaju.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako to ne uspe, ili ako je napad već uznapredovao, na redu su triptani. Kratkodelujući&amp;#8212;-sumatriptan je klasičan primer&amp;#8212;-su dobri za abortivnu terapiju; oni sa dužim delovanjem mogu biti povremena profilaksa kod periodičnih migrena, najčešće&amp;nbsp;menstrualnih.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samo su dve grupe lekova registrovane za pravu profilaksu&amp;#8212;-beta blokatori (najčešće propranolol i nadolol) i topiramat. Drugi antiepileptici&amp;#8212;-pre svega zonisamid&amp;#8212;-nisu registrovani, ali se često koriste, kao i antidepresivi i&amp;nbsp;spazmolitici.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ako ništa od toga ne upali, poslednja linija odbrane je&amp;#8212;-botoks. Tromesečne injekcije botoksa u 31 tačku na licu, slepoočnicama i vratu nekada mogu da pomognu kod teških refraktornih migrena. Kad već imate glavobolju, bar da izgledate&amp;nbsp;lepo&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;

Najbolji lek za uganuće zgloba je vreme. Hiperaktivnim pre-podne-trčim-uveče-dižem-tegove japijima to ne ulazi u glavu; hoće da se sve popravi &lt;em&gt;odmah&lt;/em&gt;, kao da im je telo auto koji mehaničar može čas da remontuje. Ovakvi mogu biti i roditelji, od kojih neki imaju kolumnu u &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After years of reporting on health, I considered myself a well-informed patient, but it took my elementary-school daughter to state the obvious: She was the victim of too much medicine. Every new blood test, scan or X-ray raised new questions, which led to more lab work, scans and X-rays. I know the doctors had good intentions, but it’s a truism of modern medicine that the more you test and scan and look for problems, the more likely you are to find something wrong. My daughter’s case had spiraled out of&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nisu samo pacijenti nestrpljivi. Ni doktori nemaju&amp;nbsp;vremena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We in medicine no longer spend time doing the careful history and physical examination that will minimize these costs.  Our insurance system, unfortunately following Medicare&amp;#8217;s lead, pays more for tests than for a careful examination.  A careful history and physical takes time.  But we in medicine are not &amp;#8220;rewarded&amp;#8221; for taking enough time with patients.  Our administrators tell us that we have to see more patients per hour.  They focus on the volume not the&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/6924"&gt;High value, cost conscious care – the antithesis of too much care — db&amp;#8217;s Medical Rants&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients (and physicians) too often forget that time is our friend. We become impatient when the physician cannot explain the symptom(s) immediately, so we abandon our generalist and figure that the subspecialist is a better&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(via &lt;a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/6926"&gt;More thoughts on high value, cost conscious care — db&amp;#8217;s Medical Rants&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subspecijalista će, kada mu pošaljete pacijenta, obaviti bar jednu od širokog dijapazona dijagnostičkih i terapijskih procedura za koje osiguranje lepo plaća&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Indikacija se lako&amp;nbsp;iznalazi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovo nije (isključivo) zbog para. Kao što ne biste plaćali vodoinstalatera da samo pogleda cevi i kaže da je sve u redu, tako i subspecijalisti očekuju da onaj ko im šalje pacijenta već zna da &lt;em&gt;nešto&lt;/em&gt; fali, a da su oni tu da pripomognu nekom kolonoskopijom, injekcijom steroida u koleno i sl.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Za dijagnozu su potrebne dve stvari: infiltrat na rentgenu grudnog koša, i bar dva od sledeća četiri simptoma: dispneja, kašalj, povišena temperatura i bol u&amp;nbsp;grudima.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jedina klinički bitna podela je na &amp;#8220;običnu&amp;#8221;&lt;sup id="fnref:0"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; i nozokomijalnu. Ovu drugu ima svako ko je proveo više od 48 sati u bolnici u poslednjih 90 dana, ko je u staračkom domu, ili ko redovno ide na hemoterapiju ili hemodijalizu. Sve što sledi odnosi se na običnu&amp;#8212;-nozokomijalna je komplikovanija&amp;nbsp;zverka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sećate se podele na tipičnu i atipičnu pneumoniju u zavisnosti od uzročnika? To nema veze sa stvarnošću. Prezentacija može biti tipična ili atipična, ali nije pokazana bilo kakva veza između uzročnika i simptoma. Štaviše, kod 50% hospitalizovanih pacijenata kulture sputuma i krvi, kao i antigeni legionele i pneumokoka u urinu su negativni, a terapija čisto empirijska; pacijentima koji nisu za bolnicu kulture se i ne&amp;nbsp;proveravaju.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sećate li se onoga: lobarna, bronhialveolarna, intersticijalna&amp;#8230;? Ne opterećujte se time&amp;#8212;- možda jeste važno patolozima na obdukciji, ali se ne koristi u određivanju&amp;nbsp;terapije.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Šta onda odlučuje terapiju? Statistika. Ko je mlad&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, inače zdrav, i dođe u ordinaciju sa temperaturom, kašljem i infiltratom može da prođe samo sa nekim β-laktamom (obično Amoksiklav), makrolidom (obično azitromicin) ili doksiciklinom&amp;nbsp;(najjeftiniji).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ko je stariji, bolesniji, i dalje ima simptome posle 5-7 dana terapije ili je uzimao antibiotike iz nekog drugog razloga u poslednjih 30 dana dobija β-laktam &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLUS&lt;/span&gt; makrolid, ili neki respiratorni fluorohinolon (odnosno, moksi- ili&amp;nbsp;levofloksacin).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ovima iz prethodne stavke dobro je izračunati &lt;a href="http://www.mdcalc.com/curb-65-severity-score-community-acquired-pneumonia/" title="mdcalc.com | CURB-65 Severity Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CURB&lt;/span&gt;-65&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;-ko ima dva ili više poena trebalo bi bar na kratko da bude hospitalizovan za par dana intravenskih antibiotika i&amp;nbsp;posmatranja.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kome nije do sabiranja prostih brojeva može da pošalje u bolnicu svakog muškarca starijeg od 75 ili ženu stariju od 80, sve koji imaju temperaturu preko 40C, puls preko 125 i/ili pritisak ispod 90/60&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; i sve sa drugim “aktivnim medicinskim stanjima”&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ko baš voli matematiku može svom hospitalizovanom pacijentu da izračuna &lt;a href="http://pda.ahrq.gov/clinic/psi/psicalc.asp" title="Pneumonia Severity Index Calculator"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, čisto da se porodica ne bi iznenadila u slučaju smrtnom ishoda. Da, čak i u bogatijim zemljama ljudi umiru od pneumonije&amp;#8212;-15% svih hospitalizovanih pacijenata, do čak 30% ako su imunokompromitovani. Doduše, pneumonija je tu obično &amp;#8220;poslednja&amp;nbsp;kap&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specijalni slučajevi &lt;em&gt;nenozokomijalne&lt;/em&gt; pneumonije: alkoholičari i oni sa lošim zubima (sleduje im i klindamicin za oralne anaerobe), pacijenti sa cističnom fibrozom i bronhiektazijama (obavezna hospitalizacija i anti-pseudomonalni lekovi), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;-om (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCP&lt;/span&gt;! Mada je i kod njih mnogo češći&amp;nbsp;pneumokok)&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popularna nauka, sa dva savršena voditelja. Možda ima samo pet punih emisija godišnje, uz desetak samo-za-internet kratkih komada, ali su sve za slušanje po pet, deset, petnaest puta. Svaka epizoda mi je kao političaru funkcija&amp;#8212;-sve su mi omiljene&amp;#8212;-ali ako moram da izdvojim, Lost &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Found spomenut u &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/magazine/mag-10Radiolab-t.html?pagewanted=all" title="How 'Radiolab' Is Transforming the Airwaves - NYTimes.com"&gt;ovom članku&lt;/a&gt; sam slušao najviše puta.

Hopkins je 21 godinu zaredom bio najbolji. Više&amp;nbsp;ne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bostonski &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MGH&lt;/span&gt;, prošle godine trećeplasirani, rešio je da svoje dosta slabo odeljene za &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ORL&lt;/span&gt; pripoji mnogo bolje rangiranom &lt;a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/otolaryngology/" title="The Department of Otolaryngology (ENT) - Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA"&gt;Institutu za oko i uho&lt;/a&gt;. To je bilo doboljno da sa začelja skoči na treće mesto &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ORL&lt;/span&gt; liste (ipak iza Hopkinsa), što ih je u ukupnon preračunu sa trećeg mesta stavilo na vrh. Iako ni u jednoj pojedinačnoj oblasti u stvari nisu pali, Hopkins je tako izgubio titulu&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Po onome što sam čuo od ljudi koji su tamo bili na specijalizaciji, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MGH&lt;/span&gt; je klasična bela, maligna, rasistička bolnica u kojoj se specijalizanti kinje i izrabljuju, i u kojoj do pre dvadesetak godina crnci i jevreji nisu mogli da se zaposle. Doduše, ti koji su mi pričali sada rade za Hopkins&amp;#8212;-o konkurenciji sve&amp;nbsp;najgore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Najveći gubitnik je Mejo, večiti drugi, sa reputacijom finog, kulturnog i socijalno pravednog programa&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, koji je pao na treće&amp;nbsp;mesto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovo rangiranje bolnica je samo na prvi pogled glupo i detinjasto. Većina pacijenata nema puno izbora, i na mesto lečenja je osuđena geografijom. Ali bogati šeici koji poklanjaju milijardu dolara vredne kule vrlo vode računa da kukove i kolena menjaju na pravom mestu. Sad, što je metodologija prevashodno zasnovana na reputaciji i time koliko su pacijenti zadovoljni lečenjem&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, to su sitnice. Bitno je da si broj&amp;nbsp;jedan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moj matični Sinaj nije rangiran na nacionalnoj listi, ali je dobio pohvale za desetak oblasti, uključujući onkologiju. Svoju kulu moraće da isfinansiraju&amp;nbsp;sami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomirao sam na Medicinskom fakultetu u Novom Sadu (odsek stomatologija) i moj resume posle 7 godina koliko mi je trebalo da zavrsim faks izgleda tako jadno da kad bi postojao neki jednodnevni kurs stomatologije za decu ometenu u razvoju moja praksa bi licila upravo na to. Hajde da se ogradim odmah na pocetku i spomenem kako sam bio jedan od boljih u generaciji, cisto da bacimo pravo svetlo na ostatak ovog teksta (citaj, ima i&amp;nbsp;gorih).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svega 2 ekstrakcije i to prva tako sto mi asistent pridrzava ruku, a druga parodontopaticni zub koji se toliko klati da bi pusterom mogao da se izduva van. Keep in mind, vezbe iz oralne hirurgije traju vise od godinu&amp;nbsp;dana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Napunio 5 kanala korena, sto je bila norma. Medjutim, normu posle godinu dana nisam ispunio kao ni mnogi (imao svega 3), tako da su se narednog semestra organizovali dodatni casovi za nas nesretnike. Ta usluga naravno nije bila free (o, da). Troje ljudi na stolici, sa svega dva termina nedeljno, pritom sami vijamo pacijente, a ako vec nije dovoljno komplikovano da dodam kako nije smela (ni slucajno) da se koristi turbina. Pacijenti su provodili na stolici po 3 do 4 sata u proseku (tu onaj deo sa turbinom ima itekako veze). Dalje u rezumeu stoji i 0 (slovima nula) proteza, dve nadogradnje (lucky me) i uklanjane mekih naslaga (jedan od najkomplikovanijih zahvata u stomatologiji) i to mu dodje to, posle ovoga ostaje samo computer skills and languages, gde sam srecom jak&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, studije pamtim po tome sto sam upoznao neke sjajne ljude, sto sam puno putovao i na jednom od putovanja i upoznao devojku iz Rusije koja mi je u medjuvremenu postala zena i mi smo sada tnx God u Chicagu. Vreme protraceno na moje upoznavanje sa stomatologijom je heavy, heavy&amp;nbsp;waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moja zadnja vežba (blok) iz interne je bila moja tačka ključanja jer je profesor pokušao nešto da nam diktira na šta je meni pukao film i pitao sam otvoreno celu grupu: “Ko je video akutni infarkt miokarda na prijemu?”. Kako niko nije digao ruku profesor se napravio posramljenim i potrudio da nas prebaci kolegi i ode&amp;nbsp;kući.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stojim pri tome da su Američka i Engleska medicina&amp;nbsp;najbolje.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na svu sreću imao sam prilike da &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RADIM&lt;/span&gt; 5 nedelja u engleskoj bolnici. Ovo nije bila fakultetska razmena gde ja stojim sa strane i “odblejim” 2h i odem kući već sam imao ista prava i obaveze kao njihovi studenti završnih godina (radno vreme 8-24h) a moja nadređena je čvrsto verovala da studenti služe za scut work i da ih ne treba štediti ni u ludilu. Naravno, ja znam engleski gotovo isto kao i srpski pa mi komunikacija nije predstavljala veći&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ja sam za tih 5 nedelja (često) danonoćnog rada naučio više nego za 6 godina&amp;nbsp;ovde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio sam tamo sa engleskim lekarima i studentima kao i švajcarskim i nemačkim studentima (work-placement kao i ja) i odgovorno tvrdim da ni naš najbolji student ne može da priđe njihovim (nemačkim, švajcarskim i engleskim) prosečnim studentima završne godine po kliničkom znanju i umeću (predkliničko znanje nije bitno jer smo mi lekari a ne biomedicinski inženjeri) a verujem da ni većina naših specijalista kao ni profesora ne mogu prići većini njihovih specijalizanata (a možda i stažista i&amp;nbsp;studenata).&lt;/p&gt;

Po &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;-u, za nekoga bez drugih većih zdravstvenih problema pregled bi se sastojao iz par pitanja (da li se zadišete kad hodate normalnom brzinom?) i nijedne laboratorijske analize ili druge dijagnostike. Na žalost, takvi pacijenti nam uvek donose spisak hirurgovih želja (hemija, krvna slika, ekg i analiza urina su minimum, a često upadne i rentgen grudnog koša). Mi prevrćemo očima, teška srca potpisujemo naloge, i smejemo se zatucanim hirurzima iza&amp;nbsp;leđa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A onda mi devojka od dvadeset i nešto godina dođe na &lt;em&gt;rutinsku kontrolu&lt;/em&gt;. Poslednjih par decenija ti sistematski pregledi postali su pandan tehničkom pregledu auta. Ljudi sebe valjda zamišljaju kao automobile koji posle x godina ili y pređenih kilometara dođu kod lekara da im proveri hlađenje, zameni ulje, ako treba promeni gume ili ne daj bože pročačka nešto u motoru. Tako se na vreme otkriva rak, sprečava šlog, pronalazi srčana mana… Mi, u večitom strahu od tužbe, postavljamo gomilu besmislenih pitanja (jer je nekakvu glavobolju, gorušicu ili problem sa izlučivanjem neke od telesnih tečnosti imalo 99% ljudi starijih od 20), radimo bespotrebne analize (osnovna hemija, krvna slika, urin i lipidi su baterija od oko 20 testova), i kažemo im da dođu za godinu dve, da obnovimo gradivo. U najboljem slučaju malo ranije otkrijemo neku bolest koja bi se ionako ispoljila i naterala ih da dođu. U najgorem, traumiramo ljude i naručujemo još više testova zbog jednog abnormalnog rezultata. Znači, nismo ništa bolji od hirurga, a oni bar znaju i nešto konkretno da&amp;nbsp;urade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klatno se polako vraća na stranu manje testova i proređenog skrininga. Mamogram se preporučuje između 50 i 60 godina, jer pre toga ima previše lažno pozitivnih rezultata koji žene samo traumiraju, sa zanemarljivim brojem spašenih godina života. Papa-Nikolau za rak grlića materice sada se &lt;a href="//www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/cervcancer/cervcancerrs.htm"&gt;ne radi pre 21. godine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSA&lt;/span&gt; za detekciju raka prostate [možda i ne treba proveravati][2], dovoljno je jednom uraditi skrining za osteoporozu i verovatno možete biti mirni [sledećih 15 godina][3], a kolonoskopija posle 50. godine za pronalaženje kolorektalnog karcinoma vas [pokriva na&amp;nbsp;10][4].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  [2]: //www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsprca.htm
     [3]: //www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1107142
        [4]: //www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspscolo.htm
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ova tri skrining testa—za karcinom grlića materice, dojke i debelog creva—su jedini sa dokazanom vrednošću. Ako tome dodate jedan ultrazvuk abdomena svakom muškarcu starijem od 65 koji je ikada pušio, kao&lt;a href="//www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsaneu.htm"&gt;skrining za aneurizmu aorte&lt;/a&gt;, i povremenu proveru glikemije i lipida kod starih, gojaznih i pušača, pokrili ste sve što se danas može proveriti. Spisak nije veliki i, osim za rak grlića materice, obuhvata isključivo one starije od 50. Sve ostalo treba tražiti samo ako su nečiji simptomi dovoljno izraženi da zbog njih moraju kod&amp;nbsp;lekara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovih nekoliko stvari je minimum minimuma koji bi čak i u Srbiji lako mogao da se ispuni. Naravno, isto kao što su bolja higijena i pravovremena vakcinacija učinili mnogo više za suzbijanje zaraznih bolesti od antibiotika, tako je i mnogo bolji način prevencije hroničnih nezaraznih bolesti normalna ishrana, fizička aktivnost i &lt;a href="//www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/tobaccosmoke/factsheet.html"&gt;neizlaganje mutagenima&lt;/a&gt;. Ali to je već postalo opšte mesto koje u zemlji prasećih pečenja i cigarete posle fudbala ne vredi ni&amp;nbsp;spominjati.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2012 15:40:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2012-03-09:/srb/2012/03/09/preventiva/</guid></item><item><title>Pare</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2011/09/25/pare/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Medicinsko obrazovanje u Srbiji nije besplatno, iz bar dva razloga. Prvi, prozaičan&amp;#8212;-pare za plate, opremu, održavanje odnekuda moraju doći. Manjim delom od samofinansirajućih studenata, uglavnom od &lt;del&gt;države&lt;/del&gt;poreskih obveznika&amp;#8212;-naših roditelja, kojima 2/3 plate ode na poreze i doprinose, i firmi koje su premale i nedovoljno povezane da, kao Mišković, porez plaćaju u&amp;nbsp;Nikoziji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugi, bitniji&amp;#8212;-plaćamo ga svojim vremenom. Po broju sati provedenih na faksu i u učenju medicina u Beogradu sve više podseća na &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;, a po količini time dobijenog praktičnog znanja na susednu mu Višu&amp;nbsp;poslovnu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da, neki Amerikanci plaćaju smešno velike školarine za četiri godine koledža i još četiri medicine. Za te pare, doduše, njihov prosečan student završne godine zna i može više od većine srpskih specijalizanata, a opet u staž ulazi sa većim strahom nego naši studenti. Jer zna da ga pravo učenje tek&amp;nbsp;čeka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad, da sam rođen u Americi sasvim sigurno ne bih upisao medicinu. Dug od 150.000$ posle diplomiranja da bih radio 80 sati nedeljno za tri puta manje godišnje pre nego što specijaliziram ipak je previše1. Ali i to je bolja situacija od one u kojoj se nađe prosečan srpski student: bar šest godina u minusu, a bez posla, bez para i sa vrlo malo upotrebljivog znanja. Tek u to ne bih ulazio, da sam onomad&amp;nbsp;znao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da ne bude da samo pljuckam sa balkona i teram srpske medicinare na samoubistvo: počeću da pišem i o ono nešto malo korisnih i univerzalno primenljivih stvari koje sam naučio ovde. Čisto da znate šta sledeći put da kažete strini sa holesterolom&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NB&lt;/span&gt;: Pre nego što se upuste u celo ovo planinarenje, Amerikanci bar imaju ideju o tome šta ih čeka kada dobiju&amp;nbsp;diplomu&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2011 11:23:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2011-09-25:/srb/2011/09/25/pare/</guid></item><item><title>Dobrovoljni robovi</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2011/09/19/dobrovoljni-robovi/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Poslednje tri godine našeg faksa specijalno su osmišljene da obezbede srpskom zdravstvu jednu stvar: besplatnu nisko-do-srednje kvalifikovanu radnu snagu. Predavanja se jednako, možda i više, bave ezoteričnim jedan-u-sto-miliona sindromima koliko bolestima koje viđamo svaki dan. Udžbenici su u proseku stari 5-10 godina, a ono što je u njima napisano bar 10-15. Na vežbama se pridržavaju zidovi ili zlostavljaju pacijenti (jer 10 studenata na dva pacijenta u sobi od 10 kvadrata može biti samo zlostavljanje), dok asistenti i profesori upozoravaju kako u Srbiji nema posla, kako država nema para za lekare, i o čemu li smo kog đavola mislili kad smo upisivali medicinu. Na ispitu sledi iščuđavanje na to koliko se malo zna, zašto se nije išlo na predavanja i vežbe (iste one koje dobar broj asistenata nije ni držao), i&amp;#8212;poseban udar na one sa novog programa&amp;#8212;zar ste stvarno mislili hirurgiju da date u junu, koleginice? Ne može to posle samo godinu dana slušanja i četiri meseca&amp;nbsp;spremanja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do pre par godina coup-de-grace bila je higijena, ispiračica mozgova. Ne znam kakva je situacija sada, ali sledeće je sigurno: ogroman broj ljudi koji su prekliniku znali dobro/odlično i koji su se na klinici u početku&amp;#8212;možda i do samog kraja&amp;#8212;trudili da nešto nauče, u trenutku kada im G-đa Đević svečano uruči Uverenje o diplomiranju misli kako veze sa medicinom nema, kako su poslednjih 6+ godina proveli u izmaglici u kojoj su izgubili mladost, zdravlje i samopoštovanje, i kako njihovo vreme ne vredi ništa, a oni sami još manje od&amp;nbsp;toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sasvim je onda normalno da je volontiranje (zašto bi vas neko plaćao kad ionako ne vredite) u Kliničkom centru ili ekvivalentnoj velikoj ka-nastavi-okrenutoj ustanovi (gde ćete konačno moći da vidite i uradite sve što niste kao student) prava premija. Kada se posle dve-tri godine bavljenja &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Scut"&gt;scut&lt;/a&gt;-om i produžene adolescencije ljudi opamete i počnu da traže pravi posao, nova ekipa sveže diplomiranih sluđenih Dr-eva spremna je za žrtvovanje. Ko nije rođen u Beogradu može bar da se vrati u rodni kraj, gde je volontiranje kraće a posao posle toga izvesniji. Ko je iz Beograda može samo da traži vezu&amp;#8212;za kraće volontiranje na boljem mestu. Jedino strateški postavljena sekretarica može ljudima obezbediti nešto što se plaća, obično onima koji&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"&gt;nemaju sumnji u svoje medicinsko znanje&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre par meseci objavljeno je istraživanje (koje sada, naravno, ne mogu da nađem) po kome kvalitet medicinske edukacije u američkim školama nije zavisio od broja profesora ili njihovog istraživačkog rada, niti od školarine (koja ide od 12-75.000$ po godini). Jedina razlika između uspešnih i manje uspešnih škola bio je prosečan broj pacijenata koje jedan student vidi i prati u toku školovanja. Taj broj je na beogradskom faksu&amp;#8212;nula, pošto o praćenju pacijenata na način na koji se to radi ovde naši studenti mogu samo da sanjaju. Da bi se to izvelo, nastava bi morala da se drži u blokovima, u njoj bi morali da učestvuju svi koji su za to plaćeni, a vizite bi morale da liče na nešto. Nemoguća&amp;nbsp;misija.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disklejmer: Student nisam od 2008. a van faksa sam skoro godinu i po. Ako se nešto u međuvremenu promenilo na bolje, super&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2011 14:30:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2011-09-19:/srb/2011/09/19/dobrovoljni-robovi/</guid></item><item><title>USMLE</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2011/03/21/usmle/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Diplomirao sam u junu 2008, sa ok prosekom, par radova iz histologije, nešto demonstrature i bez sasvim jasne ideje šta i kako dalje. Šest meseci kasnije, nakon &lt;del&gt;seks turizma&lt;/del&gt; naučne razemene na Tajlandu, par nedelja u Libeku i skoro završenog staža, izbor sam sveo na ostanak u Srbiji i pečalbu u Nemačkoj ili Americi. Kako i zašto sam se na kraju odlučio za Ameriku i zašto mi se baš i nije ostajalo u Srbiji je duga priča, ali da, postojala je tabela sa plusevima i minusima za svaku od te tri opcije, i da, još uvek je čuvam. Prvog januara 2009. počelo je zvanično prikupljanje informacija i literature o polaganju &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt;-a, krajem maja izašao sam na Step 1, tri nedelje kasnije na Step 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CK&lt;/span&gt;, a početkom jula i na &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;. U septembru sam se prijavio na programe, decembru i januaru išao na razgovore, a pre skoro tačno godinu dana, u martu 2010, saznao gde odlazim. Dakle, oko pet i po meseci ukupnog spremanja prva dva stepa1, i još par nedelja za &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;. Jeste, moguće&amp;nbsp;je.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kada me neko onda pita kako se &amp;#8220;nostrifikuje diploma&amp;#8221;2/sprema &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt;, na to pitanje mogu da odgovorim kao neko ko je u celu stvaru ušao jako kasno i ko se time nije bavio previše dugo. Uz tu ogradu, par&amp;nbsp;saveta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. _Saznajte šta polažete. _Sve informacije za strance koji žele specijalizaciju u &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAD&lt;/span&gt; su &lt;a href="http://www.ecfmg.org" title="ECFMG"&gt;na sajtu &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECFMG&lt;/span&gt;-a&lt;/a&gt;. Ko nema apsolutno nikakvog pojma o celom konceptu,&amp;nbsp;ukratko:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 1 - preklinika, 322 pitanja sa ponuđenim odgovorima, 7 sati rada + 1&amp;nbsp;odmora;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CK&lt;/span&gt; - klinika, 352 pitanja sa ponuđenim odgovorima, 8+1&amp;nbsp;sat;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; (clinical skills) - 12 &amp;#8220;pacijenata&amp;#8221;, 15 minuta za svakog + 10 za pisanje izveštaja, ocenjuju se uzimanje anamneze, pregled, izveštaj i (najvažnije!) smeškanje, pranje ruku i gledanje u&amp;nbsp;oči.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cena promenljiva (na žalost, samo u jednom smeru), oko 800-900$ za prva dva, 1300-1400$ za treći. Opet, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECFMG&lt;/span&gt; je najbolji izvor za najsvežije&amp;nbsp;informacije.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;Nabavite literaturu.&lt;/em&gt; Previše ljudi spremanje za &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; shvati kao šansu da nadoknade ono što su propustili sedeći u Kapriju3. Onda fiziologija krene da se sprema iz Gajtona, patologija iz Robinsa a interna iz Harisona, što je sve teško gubljenje vremena. Iako teorijski u obzir može doći sve, obim onoga što se najčešće pita je ograničen, savladiv i lako dostupan kroz jednu od milion različitih serija knjiga specijalno pisanih za pripremu juesemelija (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRS&lt;/span&gt;, Kaplan, High-Yield, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XYZ&lt;/span&gt; Made Ridiculosuly Simple&amp;#8230;). Iako sve one pokrivanju manje-više istu materiju, nešto tera ljude da čitaju bar dve-tri iz iste oblasti. Opet, gubljenje vremena. Nađite seriju koja vam po stilu najviše odgovara, i držite se&amp;nbsp;toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ono što je meni sasvim lepo poslužilo za Step 1: First Aid (baza), Pathology Rapid Review (aka Goljan), Kaplan Biochemistry, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRS&lt;/span&gt; Physiology, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRS&lt;/span&gt; Bihevioral Science, Microbiology Made Ridiculosly Simple, High-Yield Molecular&amp;nbsp;Biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;Napravite strategiju&lt;/em&gt;. Ovo je ključno: bez jasno postavljenih vremenskih rokova i plana rada, spremanje samo jednog stepa može da se otegne u godine. Meni je najviše pomoglo &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2160207/Blog/USMLE%20%26%20COMLEX%20Guide.doc" title="USMLE and COMLEX guide.doc"&gt;ovo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;vodič za spremanje koji sam našao na &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDN&lt;/span&gt; forumu4. Literaturu sam skoro potpuno preuzeo&amp;nbsp;odatle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podrazumeva se da imate bar neku ideju koje vam oblasti slabije idu (uz bihejvioralne nauke, koje su svima slaba tačka), i na šta treba posebno da se koncentrišete. Ako ne znate, tu su &lt;a href="http://www.nbme.org/students/sas/sas.html" title="NBME Self-Assessment"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; testovi, 50-60$ komad, svaki sa po 200/184 pitanja (za Step 1/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;2CK&lt;/span&gt;) koja su se nekad pojavljivala na pravim testovima i lepo spakovanim izveštajem po oblastima na&amp;nbsp;kraju.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.&lt;em&gt; Fokusirajte se&lt;/em&gt;. Ako ste u vezi dok spremate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; a dečko/devojka se ne žali kako vas ne viđa dovoljno i kako samo o testu pričate, onda nešto nije u redu, ili sa vezom ili sa spremanjem. Ako na poslu imate previše obaveza, uzmite bolovanje. Ako suviše vremena trošite na pranje sudova i čišćenje stana, preselite se nazad kod roditelja. Ako vam &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; nije prioritet, bolje je da celu stvar batalite. Ovo sve važi za one koji sa celom stvari kreću nakon diplomiranja; ako Step 1 polažete dok ste još na faksu, prioritet je, naravno, završavanje&amp;nbsp;istog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;em&gt;Obnavljajte, obnavljajte, obnavljajte&lt;/em&gt;. Računam da je ovo već blisko nekome ko je završio medicinu. Tu najviše pomaže samotestiranje. Postoji gomila zbirki sa &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt;-style pitanjima, ali je kraljica svih baza &lt;a href="http://www.usmleworld.com" title="USMLE World"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; World&lt;/a&gt;. Ne samo da potpuno simulira softver za polaganje, već su i pitanja jako slična onima (od težih) koja se vide na pravom testu. Osim toga, objašnjenje za svako pitanje je mala lekcija za&amp;nbsp;sebe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Još jedna korisna stvar, naročito za stvari koje se moraju učiti napamet, je pravljenje fleš kartica. Ta tema je i široka i duboka, pa ću samo dati nekoliko linkova: &lt;a href="http://www.supermemo.com" title="Supermemo"&gt;Supermemo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ankisrs.net" title="Anki"&gt;Anki (program)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://anki.ichi2.net" title="Anki"&gt;Anki (online)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;em&gt;Znajte šta sledi&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; (valjda) niko ne polaže zbog ličnog zadovoljstva i/ili mazohističkih poriva, već da bi dobio specijalizaciju u Americi. Da bi se do toga došlo, treba preskočiti još puno prepona, od birokratske noćne more zvane Medical Education Credentials Verification (iliti nostrifikacije diplome), do niza drugi skraćenica tipa &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ERAS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NRMP&lt;/span&gt; i &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FSMB&lt;/span&gt; koje će vam biti potrebne za prijavu na programe, rangiranje istih i eventualno polaganje Stepa 3. Opet, objašnjenje za sve je na &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECFMG&lt;/span&gt;-ovom sajtu i u detalje ne treba ni ulaziti dok nemate položen bar Step 1, ali je za prikupljanje pisama preporuke i ostale dokumentacije za &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ERAS&lt;/span&gt; na vreme potrebna takva logistika, da je bolje spremiti se&amp;nbsp;unapred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kratko i površno, ali nadam se korisno. Kad budem imao vremene (a kako me je krenulo sa laganim noćnim dežurstvima, imaću ga poprilično), svaku od ovih tačaka ću u detalje. Inače, &lt;a href="http://doccartoon.blogspot.com/2011/03/types-of-night-pages-from-nurses.html" title="A Cartoon Guide to Becoming a Doctor"&gt;evo čime se bavim poslednjih par dana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 trebalo je da polažem sredinom aprila. Zbog problema sa zakazivanjem morao sam to da pomerim za celih mesec dana i spremanje &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CK&lt;/span&gt; počnem pre položenog keca. Ne&amp;nbsp;preporučujem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; nije nikakva nostrifikacija (mada je za njegovo polaganje potrebno verifikovati diplomu), već neka vrsta državnog ispita. Ako neko kaže da &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USMLE&lt;/span&gt; sprema xy meseci/godina a još uvek taj proces meša sa nostrifikacijom, pripreme očigledno nisu&amp;nbsp;ozbiljne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holivudu, Luju, Jarcu&amp;#8212;ne&amp;nbsp;deskriminišem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O forumima: postoji ih gomila, i na većini vise večiti spremači porekla uglavnom azijskog. Onaj na koji sam ja išao za savete o spremanju bio je&lt;a href="http://forums.studentdoctor.net" title="SDN Forum"&gt;StudentDoctorNetwork&lt;/a&gt;, jedini sa većinskim američkim (pa još štreberskim)&amp;nbsp;članstvom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Ceo blog&amp;#8212;-&lt;a href="http://doccartoon.blogspot.com/" title="A Cartoon Guide to Becoming a Doctor"&gt;A Cartoon Guide to Becoming a Doctor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;-je odličan. Prelistajte malo stare stripove i obratite pažnju na svaki u kome se pojavljuju specijalizanti (intern ili resident). Ko god ih je crtao, znao je tačno šta radi&amp;#8212;-stažistu ćete u svakoj bolnici ovde prepoznati po tome što neprestano pišti. Da svaki lekar u Americi sa sobom nosi pejdžer i ume da uradi traheotomiju uz pomoć kuhinjskog noža i hemijske olovke zna svako ko je gledao bilo koji film ili seriju o doktorima snimljenu od osamdesetih naovamo. Ovo drugo jeste preterivanje, ali pedjžeri se zaista još uvek koriste i, u stvari, nisu ni izbliza toliko naglašeni na ekranu koliko u stvarnom&amp;nbsp;životu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Za početak, ima ih svako&amp;#8212;-od čistačice (kojoj svakih 15-20 minuta stigne novo zaduženje), do direktora bolnice. Medicinske sestre su tu privilegovane, jer umesto pejdžera imaju oko vrata obešenu Voceru, hands-free sokoćalo sa zvučnikom i mikrofonom kojim se upravlja glasom. Ruke su im, valjda, uglavnom suviše zauzete da se cimaju sa pejdžerima. Specijalisti i stariji specijalizanti imaju novije modele, sa tastaturom, tako da bar mogu da odgovore na poruku bez potezanja telefona. Nama jadnim stažistima ostaju oni najobičniji - tri reda, osamdeset karaktera, bez tastature, ca. 1980. Komunikacija isključivo&amp;nbsp;jednosmerna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Da se ne lažemo, osećaj na orijentaciji kad ti uruče mantil i pejdžer je dosta dobar. Vau, imam svoj pejdžer, kao pravi doktor. Vidi, ima isto zvono kao Hausova ekipa.&amp;nbsp;Kul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A onda dođe prvi dan na odeljenju, i polako spravica postaje da bude sve manje kul a sve više trozubac kojim te neko podbada svakih desetak minuta. Napisah već jednom da sam prvog dana na odeljenju nasledio devet pacijenata. Prva stvar koju sam morao da uradim, pre onog obilaženja svih osmoro u roku od dva sata, je ceremonijalno stavljanje svog imena u njihov elektronski karton. Čisto da bi sestre znale koga da cimaju u slučaju da se nešto desi ili im nešto&amp;nbsp;treba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evo kako to funkcioniše: dobro obučena sestra prepozna neku promenu na pacijentu, ili im oni traže nešto što ne mogu da urade, tako da kontaktiraju stažistu. Stažista vidi koliko je stvar bitna i, ako ume sam da se snađe da odgovarajuće naloge (ili priča sa pacijentom, porodicom, kime već), a ako ne&amp;#8212;-zove starijeg specijalizanta. Ovaj opet to filtrira do nadležnog specijaliste. Ako ni ovaj ne ume da se snađe, pacijent uglavnom završi na intenzivnoj a stažista nahebe jer nije zvao ranije. Nešto kao nervni sistem u kome su sestre periferni receptori, specijalisti viši nervni centri, a specijalizanti interneuroni (stažisti bi, ako ćemo baš da budemo precizni, u ovoj podeli rada bili dorzalni ganglioni, da ne kažem&amp;nbsp;ganglije).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evo kako je to izgledalo mog prvog dana: trećina pacijenata bili su stariji Afroamerikanci (da ne kažem crnci) slabijeg materijalnog i, zbog brojnih komorbiditeta, sumnjivog mentalnog stanja koji su sestre cimali svakih pet minuta; druga trećina su bili jako fini ljudi sa jako napornim porodicama koje su sestrama jako volele da spominju svoje drugare advokate pa su sestre, htele-ne htele, morale da im ugađaju; i na kraju zaista bolesni pacijenti koji su jednom nogom bili na intenzivnoj, a drugom u hospisu; i ja, apsolutno neiskusan i generalno gledano nedorastao situaciji*, koji pojma nemam koji pacijent spada u koju kategoriju i da te kategorije uopšte postoje, dok poruke jedna drugu sustižu. To da ni prethodna karika u lancu nije baš uvek na visini zadatka nije mi u tom trenutku ni ulazilo u&amp;nbsp;glavu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trećeg dana na dužnosti hteo sam da zafrljačim malo pištalo kroz&amp;nbsp;prozor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na žalost, ne sećam se prve poruke koja mi je stigla tog dana (najverovatnije je nekome sa zatvorom trebao laksativ, ili im je pritisak bio &amp;gt;160**) ali je kasnije bilo&amp;nbsp;bisera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pt wants to shower, needs order&lt;/em&gt; (negde tri ujutru, kad sam imao 30-časovno&amp;nbsp;dežurstvo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Srry to wake u, pt&amp;#8217;s bp 165/100, gave hydralazine, now 130/85 &lt;/em&gt;(pola 4 ujutru, isto dežurstvo, drugi&amp;nbsp;pacijent)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;: Patient c/o abd pain, passed gas, feels better now&lt;/em&gt; (ovo sam, srećom, primio u toku dana; ima ljudi koje su budili ovakvim&amp;nbsp;porukama)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naravno, ima i onih koje se pamte iz drugih razloga (&lt;em&gt;Ms. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMS&lt;/span&gt; during dialysis, pls come to evaluate_; _Mr. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; unresponsive after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEG&lt;/span&gt; plcmnt, come now_; _Ms. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BP&lt;/span&gt; 70/30, diaphoretic, pls come&lt;/em&gt;), ali tu je ono što se desi posle poziva mnogo zanimljivije od same poruke. Na žalost ili na sreću, takvih je veoma&amp;nbsp;malo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U ovome uopšte ne preterujem, ali je to potpuno očekivano i sistem je, bar u mojoj bolnici, pravljen da prvih par nedelja dopušta greške i opštu nekompetentnost stažista. Problemi nastaju ako se nesposobnost otegne na nekoliko&amp;nbsp;meseci.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Prvo pitanje sestri ako vam ovako nešto stigne u 8 ujutru: Da li ste pacijentu dali lekove za pritisak? Ne? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUPM&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2010 19:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2010-12-17:/srb/2010/12/17/bleep/</guid></item><item><title>26 y/o WM w/ OCD</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2010/11/19/26-yo-wm-w-ocd/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Prvi dan staža: u 7 ujutru dobijam sign-out—spisak od devet pacijenata raštrkanih po celoj bolnici koje treba da obiđem do vizite u 9. Da uopšte dođem do prvog treba mi dobrih 15 minuta, jer ne znam gde su sobe, stepeništa, liftovi (ali zahvaljujući orijentaciji koju smo imali dan pre toga znam sve o istoriji jevrejskih migracija iz centra Baltimora ka severozapadu). U 7:20 stižem nekako do šestog sprata, soba 6xx, i bacam pogled na&amp;nbsp;sign-out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59 y/o &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAF&lt;/span&gt; w/ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTN&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HLD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EF&lt;/span&gt; 51% in 7/09, ?&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM2&lt;/span&gt; p/w &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PND&lt;/span&gt;, othopnea, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LE&lt;/span&gt; swelling due to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTN&lt;/span&gt; emergency, ac. diastolic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt; 2/2 med non-adherence, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AKI&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CKD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desno od toga—spisak lekova duži od moje ruke (između ostalog: Nifedipine &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XL&lt;/span&gt; 90mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QD&lt;/span&gt;, clonidine 0.2mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BID&lt;/span&gt;, Lasix 80mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BID&lt;/span&gt;, hydralazine 100mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TID&lt;/span&gt;, isosorbide mononitrate 120mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QD&lt;/span&gt;, labetalol 800mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BID&lt;/span&gt;, metolazone 5mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BID&lt;/span&gt;, hydralazine 10mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; q6h &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRN&lt;/span&gt;, labetalol 10mg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; q5mins &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRN&lt;/span&gt;—sve to samo za pritisak i srčanu insuficijenciju; statine, antibiotike, antidijabetike i antiemetike da ne&amp;nbsp;nabrajam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na stranu kompleksnost bolesti i finese antihipertenzivne terapije u crnaca sa bubrežnom insuficijencijom—o tome ću brinuti sledećih par nedelja—nego, šta kog đavola sve one troslovne skraćenice znače (hint: do pre par godina &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AKI&lt;/span&gt; on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CKD&lt;/span&gt; bi se pisalo A on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRF&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nisam tog dana do vizite uspeo da vidim ni pola od svojih devet pacijenata, ali niko to od mene nije ni očekivao (reče mi stariji specijalizant tek nakon najstresnija dva sata u mom životu). Dovoljno je bilo što sam preživeo. Do kraja te nedelje čak sam mogao i da nađem svaku sobu bez polučasovnog traganja, a brzo posle toga pohvatao sam sve one, i još desetinu drugih skraćenica. Pre par nedelja, pred kraj rotacije na koronarnoj jedinici, upisao sam bez puno razmišljanja u sign-out jedan od prijema za taj&amp;nbsp;dan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;76 y/o &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WF&lt;/span&gt; w/ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTN&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EF&lt;/span&gt; 10% s/p &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEMI&lt;/span&gt; 7/2010, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; s/p &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BMS&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAD&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8216;08, 2xBMS to LCx 7/2010, severe pulm. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTN&lt;/span&gt; w/ baseline &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OA&lt;/span&gt;, gout, now s/p &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AICD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;10/25/10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cela ova priča za jedan link: pre par nedelja pročitao članak o tome kako je medicinska dokumentacija (d)evoluirala od epskih eseja prevashodno namenjenih edukaciji do sadašnje noćne more svih stažista i medicinskih sestara (pošto je mi uglavnom popunjavamo) koja treba da pokrije bolnicu u slučaju tužbe i olakša posao službi za naplatu kada treba da se obračuna koliko osiguranje/pacijenti duguju za boravak.

Kada je krajem &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XIX&lt;/span&gt; veka Dr. Vilijam Halsted, hirurg, izumitelj radikalne mastektomije i hirurške rukavice, i prvo kokainski pa onda morfijumski zavisnik, započeo prvi residency program u Americi (u Džons Hopkinsu, naravno) specijalizanti bi u bolnici provodili i po četiri-pet dana bez prekida, pa je taj naziv i te kako imao smisla.  Rezonovanje za takvo neljudsko radno vreme bilo je da će na taj način doktori-u-pokušaju bolje upoznati prirodni tok bolesti, i da neće propustiti nijedan bitan događaj u boravku svojih pacijenata. Osim toga, većinu svog radnog veka Dr. Halsted je proveo u kokainsko/morfijumskoj omaglici, pa su mu koncepti umora i iscrpljenosti bili prilično strani. Rukovodstvo bolnice brzo je primenilo ovaj sistem na sve novootvorene programe, i tako dobilo neiscrpan izvor jeftine radne&amp;nbsp;snage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nekoliko decenija kasnije, pod pritiskom sindikata, ipak je došlo do ograničenja radnog vremena&amp;#8212;-na 100 sati nedeljno, sa smenom koja ne sme preći 36 sati i sa obaveznih 12 sati odmora između smene. Za one bez digitrona: to je u proseku nešto više od 14 sati dnevno. Pre desetak godina, ovaj put pod pritiskom javnosti (sindikati su u međuvremenu propali), brojke su smanjene na 80 sati nedeljno sa smenama od po 30 sati. Ovih 80 sati je, u stvari, prosek između četiri uzastopne nedelje: ništa vas ne sprečava da dve nedelje radite 100 sati, a sledeće dve samo 60. Poređenja radi: radno vreme svih zaposlenih u Evropi, pa i lekara, je 40 sati nedeljno. Sve preko toga dodatno se&amp;nbsp;plaća.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poduža priča za kratku poentu: ako vam se iz mog prethodnog pisanija činilo da se žalim na radno vreme i količinu posla, niste u pravu. Ma koliko se puno radilo, dve činjenice ostaju: moj program jako, možda i previše, vodi računa da se sati apsolutno poštuju (u “pravom” Hopkinsu, sa druge strane, ponose se time da njihovi stažisti redovno prebacuju normu) i, što je još bitnije, to je ipak rad koji ima smisla. Ko je stažirao u nekom od naših domova zdravlja verovatno će me razumeti kada kažem da bih rado menjao svaki sat koji sam proveo ispisujući recepte i popunjavajući glupave zeleno/crvene formulare za bolovanje za dodatne dane rada na odeljenju&amp;nbsp;ovde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mali problem: sledeća generacija specijalizanata imaće skraćeno radno vreme. Po novim pravilima, nedeljni limit je opet 80 sati, ali su smene skraćene na maksimalnih 16 sati za stažiste i 28 sati za starije specijalizante, koji će morati mnogo više da nadziru mlađe. U prevodu: manje radne snage za bolnice, koje sada imaju nešto više od mesec dana da se potpuno reorganizuju. Osim toga, manje sati znači manje iskustva za nas, a češće smene i više ljudi koji se naizmenično brinu o pacijentima daju više prostora za greške&amp;#8212;-svako je siguran da je onaj drugi proverio rezultat nekog testa ili promenio dozu nekog leka. Delimično rešenje za to su duži i detaljniji “signout-ovi”, formalne razmene informacija između dve smene, što opet mora da uđe u onih 16 sati i oduzima vreme pravoj&amp;nbsp;medicini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nisu baš crveno/zeleni formulari, ali, na žalost, nije ni previše daleko od&amp;nbsp;toga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A da se ne uplašite previše za moje zdravlje posle ovoliko priče o 80-satnoj nedelji, evo koliko sam radio od 24.9. do&amp;nbsp;23.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ukupno sati:&amp;nbsp;279,25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prosečno sati dnevno:&amp;nbsp;9,63&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prosečno sati nedeljno:&amp;nbsp;67,41&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prosečno sati za 28 dana:&amp;nbsp;269,62&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilo je tu par 24-časovnih smena i 8-9 sati između dve smene, ali u proseku&amp;#8212;-ništa strašno. One četiri nedelje u Hopkinsu, doduše, bolje da ne&amp;nbsp;spominjem.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2010 13:34:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2010-10-21:/srb/2010/10/21/sati/</guid></item><item><title>Živ sam…</title><link>http://miljko.org/srb/2010/10/17/ziv-sam/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230; i zdrav. Poslednjih par dana čak i naspavan. Ako se neko vreme nisam
javljao, to je zato što sam bio zauzet. &amp;#8220;Zauzet&amp;#8221; znači: jurio po tada meni
potpuno nepoznatoj bolnici u potrazi za &amp;#8220;svojim&amp;#8221; pacijentima (prva dva dana
staža; nije bilo prijatno ni meni ni njima); ostajao do 23h zbog 4 prijema
u roku od 15 minuta (jedan od njih bila je mlađa ženska osoba sa septičkim šokom
i pritiskom 60/40, drugi je bio polusvesni crnac od oko 250kg sa obstruktivnom
slip apneom i arterijskim pCO2&amp;gt;70) da bih na poslu ponovo bio sledećeg dana
u 6:00; propisao dovoljno narkotika da samo čekam dan kada će mi neko iz &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DEA&lt;/span&gt;
pokucati na vrata (onkološkim pacijentima, doduše, ali 650 tableta oksikodona na
jedan recept ne može a da ne deluje sumnjivo); u jednom nezaboravnom dežurstvu
na Hopkinsu u 1:30 ujutru primao čoveka sa rakom pankreasa, sepsom i &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIK&lt;/span&gt;-om
(trombociti 7, hematokrit 18), u 3:00 zvao neurohirge i radio-onkologe da bi
hitno pregledali ženu sa novodijagnostikovanim moždanim metastazama, a od 5 do
pola 7 izvlačio pacijentkinju sa već poznatim metastazama na mozgu iz statuse
epileptikusa (neuspešno; završila je na infuziji fenitoina i, kada sam je video
par dana posle toga, poslednji put, još uvek bez svesti) i na svoje veliko
iznenađenje bio dovoljno budan i orijentisan da sve to (i još 4 dosadnija
pacijenta) predstavim na jutarnjoj viziti; morao mnogobrojnoj (n=9) porodici
sredovečne crnkinje sa nekontrolisanom hipertenzijom (220/180 na prijemu)
i potpunom bubrežnom insuficijencijom više sati da objašnjavam zašto se
šlogirala tokom hemodijalize (na koju sam je, na neki način, i ja nagovorio)
i zašto će do kraja života morati da se hrani preko gastrostome (do viših
moždanih funkcija kao što je govor nismo ni stigli); a u pauzama između svega
toga pojeo nebrojene količine bagels-a sa krem sirom i popio litre kafe (u
poslednje vreme: bez kofeina) koji se besplatno služe u doktorskoj&amp;nbsp;kafeteriji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jednom rečju, da, zadovoljan&amp;nbsp;sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naravno, tu je papirologija, diktiranje otpusnih listi, ganjanje sa sestrama oko
toga da li su i kada uzele krv za jutarnje analize, sedenje na nekada
neverovatno dosadnim (ali nekada baš dobrim) obaveznim podnevnim predavanjima
dok se na odeljenjima posao polako gomila a pejdžer samo pišti (pejdžer, ta
sprava za mučenje stažista, specijalizanata i doktora na dežurstvu, zaslužuje
ceo esej). Neke kolege su bolje od drugih, neki pacijenti teži za saradnju od
ostalih, nekih dana mogao bih u bolnici da ostanem i 48h a nekada bežim pre
četiri. So it&amp;nbsp;goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vi, kako&amp;nbsp;ste?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2010 12:23:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:miljko.org,2010-10-17:/srb/2010/10/17/ziv-sam/</guid></item></channel></rss>
