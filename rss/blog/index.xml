patients with ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema? I've had heated debates
with residents in my old clinic who did not want to even consider ARBs for
a patient with worsening diabetic nephropathy who's had lip swelling
while on an ACE-I &lt;em&gt;ten years ago&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the one about not giving these patients amlodipine, since there
are two—&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19299323"&gt;yes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330681"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;—case reports on amlodipine-associated
angioedema? Should we also stop giving them &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15120149"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are shellfish allergies and iodine contrast, fever and
atelectasis, morbid obesity and hypothyroidism… No matter how many
studies show these associations to be too weak to be clinicaly
significant, or just plain false, there will always be an attending
somewhere giving them as his or her pearl of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need some &lt;a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/335/7633/1288"&gt;medical mythbusting&lt;/a&gt; for physicians, not just the lay public.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 21 Sep 2014 09:10:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-09-21:eng/2014/09/21/its-well-known-that-most-common-knowledge-is-false/</guid></item><item><title>How to spend a Monday morning train ride</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/09/21/how-to-spend-a-monday-morning-train-ride/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://zenhabits.net/weekly-review-key-to-gtd-and-achieving/"&gt;GTD weekly review&lt;/a&gt; does a good of job keeping my task list
managable, but not all tasks and projects are equal. It's good to have
a sense of when you might have time for deep thinking versus mindless
task processing---something GTD doesn't trully account for. I had been doing a
variant of weekly planning since high school, until internship destroyed
any hope of having a &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt;, let alone weekly plan. It's time to start
again.&lt;/p&gt;

bite-sized consumable writing made for the short-attention-span---dare

the 15-year-old me, the one who had read the LotR cover to cover, be
horrified by this balding humunculus with twice the age and---if you'd believe
the articles---half the attention span?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, he would not. I can write that with confidence of a man who has just burned
through the first two &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(series)"&gt;Dark Tower&lt;/a&gt; books exclusively while riding the
subway. Get in at Union Station, actually sit down to read at Gallery Place,
blink and I'm done with a chapter or two and arriving at Bethesda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen King is a hell of a writer, you see, and most of what you can find
online---this blog post included---is derivative crap at worst, well-written
nonsense at best. My brain jumping from text to text was its way of saying &lt;em&gt;Dude,
why are you punishing me with this drivel? Just get us a good book&lt;/em&gt;. So I did,
and the percieved length of my metro commute has decreased by two orders of
magnitude. Which is a convoluted way of saying that time flies when you're
having fun&lt;sup id="fnref:crap"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:crap" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you've never read a book in your life and are now devouring Buzzfeed like

rotations. The one that is universally feared is the erroneously
named Bone marrow transplant service&lt;sup id="fnref:bmt"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bmt" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After spending six weeks
on such rotation fresh out of (Chief) residency, I think I can
understand---though not agree with---the reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not easy. The patients are either already, or about to become,
extraordinarily sick, with little outward signs or symptoms to show
it. Having cancer while not having an immune system is not a good
combination, even if it is temporary. The ones who are months or years
out from a successful transplant and still need to be hospitalized
are usually miserable from longstanding severe graft versus host
disease&lt;sup id="fnref:bias"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bias" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It makes for a tough bunch of humans to deal with
day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, being on transplant service in an academic center can be the
apex of your inpatient career. Months of residency spent on acute care
floors and in intensive care units should have given you all the skills
you need to do well. These are, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarifying ambiguity&lt;/em&gt;: The rounds are over, attendings and consultants have
  dispersed, and you have just heard more facts about T-cell activation than you
  realized existed. But---do you know if that febrile-but-not-neutropenic patient
  should get an antibiotic? What's that other patient's target Tacro
  level? Send CSF for flow, or just give intrathecal Methotrexate? If those
  aren't clear, you should have asked more questions, and not of the "Which cells
  have IL-6 receptors?" kind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Identify attending priority&lt;/em&gt;: This is often the biggest cause of ambiguity.
  Between the floor attending, the study PI, staff ID consultant, and various other
  consulting services, whose advice do you heed? Not always the same person's,
  and not even in the same order. Not much you can do, except be aware of it,
  and not follow everyone's advice as soon as you hear it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asserting your autonomy&lt;/em&gt;: With all this asking and following, you may rightly ask
  if you were anything more than a glorified intern. In the field of
  hematology, oncology, and infections that affect this population, you most
  certainly are---you are, after all, still in training. Not so for most other
  matters of internal medicine. Blood pressures, fingerstick, TSH levels---if
  you are comfortable managing them, let the team know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being there early&lt;/em&gt;: An important trait often forgotten by senior IM residents.
  Just getting there an hour earlier than anyone else to get the work done makes
  you look like a superstar. One hour in the early morning save three in the late
  afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dictating right away&lt;/em&gt;: Like, pronto. The answer to "How many pending
  dictations do you have" should always be "Zero". It's easier for you, and is
  just good patient care. No excuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writing everything down&lt;/em&gt;: This is How to be an intern 101, but being at least two
  years removed from internship can make you stupid. Carry the patient list and
  &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Push-Clip-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.4-mm-Black/pd/797"&gt;a good pen&lt;/a&gt; with you at all times. Yes, that includes the restroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing here is particular to transplants---it is just good inpatient
medicine. Which may be why so many oncology fellows loathe it---it is,
after all, an outpatient specialty. Then again, stem cell transplants
are one of the few therapies we have that can cure cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bias"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who had a stem cell transplant is
miserable---a mistaken belief many oncology fellows have after the rotation, and
a clear example of selection bias.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bias" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bmt"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stem cells used for transplants are now harvested from the
peripheral blood, not the bone marrow.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bmt" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

resident wanting to appear smart on rounds and conferences, of every
attending intent on shooting down a team member's suggestion. Five,
ten years ago it might have have signaled genuine interest. Now
it means, usually, "I don't know anything about the subject, but I'm
still calling you out on (what I think is) your BS. Here, look at me! I am
evidence-based!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, nobody has posed me that question in quite a while, and I don't
remember ever asking it in any context&lt;sup id="fnref:questions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:questions" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But, honestly,
except for a few &lt;a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/7842"&gt;very well-known examples listed in this excellent
post&lt;/a&gt;, you can find "evidence" in the medical
literature to back up any claim. Off-the-cuff conversations during
lectures and rounds are not the best place to dissect them, especially
when one side has seniority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:questions"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I understand asking questions means showing
interest, I've always preferred looking things up myself. This would
make me appear either very smart or very dumb, depending on whatever
subcontious impression I made on the person in the first few minutes of
us meeting. Try to use the halo effect to your advantage.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:questions" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, it will be a &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;-generated static site
hosted free of charge on &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squarespace is an excellent service, for those who don't have the
knowledge, time, or ambition to muck around with self-hosted websites,
but have enough readers to justify the $8/month subscription. My long
commute gives me more time to play with Python, git, vim, etc, and the
$96 renewal charge was due this month. It was an easy decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having most of my posts saved as markdown files payed off, as it is
currently impossible to get a clean conversion of old Squarespace articles to
Pelican. Some links will be dead, some images temporarily unavailable, and the
three of you reading this via RSS will need to resubscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2014 12:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-08-17:eng/2014/08/17/farewell-squarespace/</guid></item><item><title>Research during residency</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/07/25/research-during-residency/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Of the three pillars of medicine, research is the most ellusive. Unless you are
in an MD/PhD program---not an option for most Europeans---you will have other
priorities in medical school. And unless your residency program has a built-in
research year, the way most surgical residencies do, you will either be way too
busy in a university or a large community program to do any research, or have
plenty of free time in a lower volume community hospital that doesn't have many
research opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I interviewed residents-to-be last year, my first thought on seeing
a non-PhD applicant having 18 publications on his or her CV wasn't "Wow,
she is a research &lt;em&gt;machine&lt;/em&gt;, we gotta have her", but rather doubt that anyone
could be that productive during medical school. More points subtracted for
thinking the interviewers would be so gullible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated six years ago, far enough not to be able to give advice
on how to do research as a medical student. The hows and whys are
institution-specific, so anything I wrote would have to be in Serbian
anyway. Residencies, though, are similar enough to each other that I do
have some words of advice for new residents wanting to do Research! in a
community hospital, university-affiliated or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patient care trumps research.&lt;/em&gt; Unless you have already worked as an attending
  in another country before coming to the US for residency, don't waltz in to
  your PDs office on day one asking about research opportunities. Prove yourself on
  the field first, then six months later, when you're comfortable managing DVT
  prophylaxis, septic shock, and what not, start asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get your own idea?&lt;/em&gt; Common wisdom says it is better to come up
with your own question and start your own projects, since you will
be more invested in the outcome. Well, yes, sort of. Unless it is a
quick-and-dirty chart review you can do over a two-week vacation---and
even then there are IRB hoops you'd need to jump through to get anything
done---you will get your inexperienced self into the murky world of
project management. Many brilliant ideas have died on the field of
required signatures, ambiguous data points, and impossible-to-coordinate
meetings. Which is why this next advice is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find good mentors.&lt;/em&gt; Surrounding yourself with a few good people is orders of
  magnitude better than having many good ideas. Research topics come and go, as
  does our interest in different fields of medicine (yesterday's apoptosis is
  today's epigenetics is tomorrow's something or other). It
  is unlikely that the research your started in residency will continue onward
  into fellowship, but the knowledge, skills, and general wisdom you pick up from
  your mentors should serve you well into your career. NB: don't wait for someone
  to be "assigned" to you---although that's what many residency programs will
  do. Seek out people who match your character and who would be able to give you
  advice in at least three fields: patient care, research methodology, and
  research topics. This can be one person, or five. And if you find an awesome
  mentor who just isn't doing any research right then, you can always write
  a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it Science! or quality improvement?&lt;/em&gt; ACGME is big on Quality! and
  Patient Safety! this year. Programs take notice. If you can present your
  interest as a quality improvement
  project rather than small-s-science, consider doing it. Not only
  does showing interest in quality improvement look good on a CV,
  your institution might have special funds for resident QI projects.
  A dedicated QI mentor is also a good resource, if you want a carreer as a Sith
  lor---erm, hospital administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in research goes from &lt;em&gt;I just want something on my CV so I
could get a fellowship&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;When I grow up, I'll have my own lab&lt;/em&gt;, but
this applies to most people in most circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2014 06:21:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-07-25:eng/2014/07/25/research-during-residency/</guid></item><item><title>Down the vim rabithole</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/07/22/down-the-vim-rabithole/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Spending two hours each day on the train, offline and without distractions,
gives me an excuse to go down various rabbit holes that a couple of months ago
I would've thought nothing but time wasters. Starting to read the Dark Tower
series---I'm almost done with the Gunslinger---is one of them. Re-learning
vim---if dabbling with it in high school 15 years ago counts as having learned
it---is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/077-learning-vim-with-potatowire"&gt;This episode of the Technical Difficulties
podcast&lt;/a&gt;
is what started it, followed by &lt;a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/#getting-started"&gt;a blog
post&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="file:///Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Resources/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; (nay,
&lt;a href="http://www.drbunsen.org/the-text-triumvirate/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;) on the perfect setup.
Now, I may or may not continue using vim as my primary writting tool---I would
have to figure out how to integrate it into my &lt;em&gt;workflow&lt;/em&gt;---but several things
I picked up will always be useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;git is an amazing tool for tracking changes that researchers should use more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;don't blindly edit stuff---dotfiles in this particular case---on your computer
  without understanding what those edits mean &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solarized should be your default color theme for anything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;use your macro/keyboard shortcut app of choice (mine is Keyboard Maestro, you
  can just as easily---but not as prettily---use Better Touch Tools) to quickly
  position windows into quadrants, halves, thirds, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there might not be much difference between bash and zsh if you are a beginner,
  but zsh has the cool customizable prompts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am writing this in vim, previewing and exporting in Marked, then posting
it manually to Squarespace. The only thing standing between me and a fancy-pants
static website engine powering this blog is there being no internet access on
MARC trains, and me being too cheap to get a $20-a-month personal hotspot from
Spring. That is probably for the best.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2014 06:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-07-22:eng/2014/07/22/down-the-vim-rabithole/</guid></item><item><title>June 2014, final tally</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/07/01/june-2014-final-tally/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

I will have to wait until retirement for another run like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 16:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-07-01:eng/2014/07/01/june-2014-final-tally/</guid></item><item><title>Goodbye, Sinai</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/06/22/goodbye-sinai/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago today was my first day as an intern at Sinai.

It's easy enough to find advice on &lt;a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2013/9/2/how-to-surviveand-thrive-inyour-intern-year"&gt;how to be well-organized, efficient, and likable&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some more tech-oriented tips I wish I knew back when I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Take photos and videos, with permission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get an iPhone. Turn off Photo stream, or download a camera app that doesn't automatically upload to it, like &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco-cam/id588013838?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;VSCOcam&lt;/a&gt;. When a physical exam finding is rare, stumps you, or is just cool to see, ask the patient about recording it. If you see an interesting or rare radiography image, save it. But please remove all &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information"&gt;personally identifiable information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful for: appearing smart on rounds, observing disease course, creating informative slides, posters, and written case reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Keep track of things you are interested in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your EMR will have a way to create custom patient lists. Use it. If you are into hematologic malignancies, eosinophilic esophagitis, MODY—or anything, really—keep track of all your patients who have it. If you don't yet know what &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt; is, keep a list of all the patients you found interesting and try to find a pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful for: getting ideas for research and quality improvement projects, figuring out your career path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do not copy forward, copy/paste, or use templates and macros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my internship in 2010 so I can't believe I'll write this, but—&lt;em&gt;back in the day&lt;/em&gt; before EMRs, we wrote our progress notes and H&amp;amp;Ps by hand. This meant reviewing the med list, vital signs, and labs each morning and writing down only the important stuff; completing and recording just those parts of the physical exam that had to be done; and writing a new assessment and plan each day. &lt;em&gt;Well duh, isn't that what interns should do?&lt;/em&gt;—you might naively ask, until your second or third day on the job when a helpful senior resident shows you how to shave minutes—&lt;em&gt;minutes!&lt;/em&gt;—off your note-writing time by using some variant of copying forward, templates, or macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tricks are a mental crutch, and a &lt;a href="http://www.acphospitalist.org/archives/2013/04/ehr.htm"&gt;known cause of documentation errors&lt;/a&gt;. They might help your handicapped intern self the first few months on the job, but will then prevent you from thinking about what you are doing and writing. A thoughtful daily review of everyone's medications and labs will turn into a quick glance over a two-page long list of 10-point single-spaced Courier New. Also, your typing speed will never improve if you only document by clicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Useful for: being a good, thoughtful doctor.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2014 07:15:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-06-03:eng/2014/06/03/three-tech-tips-for-new-interns/</guid></item><item><title>Managing photos with Transporter, Hazel, Picturelife, and Backblaze</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/05/29/managing-photos-with-transporter-hazel-picturelife-and-backblaze/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the olden days, back when I could keep all my photos on Facebook, photo management was simple. I didn't have that many to begin with; the ones I did have were grouped around events—birthdays, vacations, etc—and easily organized into albums. I also didn't care much for privacy, or backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then two things happened: iPhone 4S, and Dora. Every day became a photo-op, with two cameras in our pockets ready to shoot. The DSLR was still there for big trips and Dora's modeling yet another outrageously expensive dress. This gave us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hundred of new photos and hours of video each month coming from four different sources (our two iPhones, a Nikon DSLR, and friends with their own cameras);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no time to sort them;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;more respect for privacy, but at the same time a need to share baby photos with everyone;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;panic attacks whenever I thought about having to organize the mess of file names, formats, storage, and backup solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed a good method to &lt;em&gt;collect&lt;/em&gt; all the photos, &lt;em&gt;organize&lt;/em&gt; them for easy access, &lt;em&gt;retrieve&lt;/em&gt; them quickly for show-off purposes, and &lt;em&gt;back them up&lt;/em&gt; both locally and in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having children usually comes at a point in your life when you care less about money and more about your time—though your progeny will do their best to relinquish you of both. The willpower-depleting effects of a toddler's tantrum are also well-documented. No surprise then that many of the tools listed below have at some point sponsored &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu"&gt;a certain Mac-centric podcast&lt;/a&gt; that has destroyed many family budgets&lt;sup id="fnref:affiliate"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:affiliate" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. No regrets, though—it all works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Collecting, with &lt;a href="http://www.filetransporter.com"&gt;Transporter Sync&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity's sake, I like systems with multiple inputs to have one central gathering node. Unfortunately, our only desktop computer is a ridiculously noisy four-year-old Windows PC which sits in a usually occupied guest bedroom. The fans that buzz with the sound of a thousand bumblebees instantly disqualify it from a job as a media server, so I had to use my Macbook Pro. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.filetransporter.com"&gt;Transporter Sync&lt;/a&gt;, that was easier than I thought possible for an SSD-only machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transporter, similarly to Dropbox, has an iOS app that automatically uploads new photos to a predetermined folder. Unlike Dropbox, there is no monthly subscription—you pay once for the device, and keep using it as long as the hard drive is working. It can also act as a NAS-lite—having access to the folders kept only on the remote hard drive without them occupying the limited space of an SSD, through a &lt;em&gt;Transporter Library&lt;/em&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Organizing, with &lt;a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php"&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A folder full of unsorted cryptically named JPEGs and RAWs is less than useful when your parents want to see all the photos from that trip to Naples back in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php"&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt;, the Swiss army knife of file automation. With the rules I've set up, it renames photos based on the date and time taken, tags them according to the device that took them, and moves them to the proper Year/Month subfolder. It does the same with our DSLR's RAW files, placing them in a separate folder. Since the laptop only has 256 Gb, it moves any files older that three months to Transporter Library, the "special" folder kept only on the external hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore have the last three months' worth of photos and videos organized by year and month on the laptop, and our entire collection on the external Transporter hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access, with &lt;a href="https://picturelife.com/?love=ESiT3XreRGzeKT5U"&gt;Picturelife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, we could get to all those photos using the Transporter iOS app, but we're not a masochists. It's slow, ugly, and not meant for browsing media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank FSM for &lt;a href="https://picturelife.com/?love=ESiT3XreRGzeKT5U"&gt;Picturelife&lt;/a&gt;! It sucks up all our new photos and videos from the Transporter—though we've excluded RAW files since we do have to pay for all that data&lt;sup id="fnref:raw"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:raw" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—presents them in a nice web and mobile app interface whenever we want it, and can pass them on to Facebook, Shutterfly, Flickr, or wherever else we choose. It will also, from time to time, send you a "this day in the past" email, with photos taken years ago. When you have as many unprocessed photos as we do, it is a great discovery mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it can send photos to Shutterfly with just a couple of clicks? I still have flashbacks of the last holiday season, progress bar dragging glacially, the upload finishing just in time for me to miss the shipping deadline. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Backup, with &lt;a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00n2ui"&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html"&gt;SuperDuper!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping everything on the Transporter and Picturelife as on-site/off-site backups would probably be enough for some. Unfortunately, counting on a VC-backed company that might at any point &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5039216/everpix-life-and-death-inside-the-worlds-best-photo-startup"&gt;pull an Everpix&lt;/a&gt; to hold all our photos does not seem optimal&lt;sup id="fnref:plife"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:plife" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is way &lt;a href="https://secure.backblaze.com/r/00n2ui"&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html"&gt;SuperDuper!&lt;/a&gt; keep copies of all those photos as a part of my general backup system&lt;sup id="fnref:bb"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bb" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If you have a Mac and an extra external hard drive, you should also turn on Time Machine. This way, there are three local copies of all the photos, RAWs, and videos (Transporter, SuperDuper! image, Time Machine), a cloud backup of the same (Backblaze), and an easily-accessible collection of JPGs and videos (Picturelife).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this up is neither cheap nor simple&lt;sup id="fnref:rg"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rg" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it gives you quick and easy access to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your photos, has several levels of backup, and—most importantly—requires little effort to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:bb"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backblaze &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; back up the Transporter Library folder, since it doesn't count as network-attached storage. It doesn't back up NAS drives.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:bb" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:raw"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep RAW files in a separate folder, one that's not on Picturelife's monitor list&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:raw" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:affiliate"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why this post has affiliate links.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:affiliate" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:plife"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, Picturelife is the best of its kind and I strongly recommend it.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:plife" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:rg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about illustrating it with a diagram of a Rube Goldberg machine.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:rg" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dozens are dead, and tens of thousands misplaced. Government officials are having nervous breakdowns on live TV, calling the flood "a Biblical catastrophe"—since touting vast water resources as your country's main asset isn't a hint as to what big disaster you should prepare for. In case you're wondering, the Netherlands' last big flood was in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_flood_of_1953"&gt;1953&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course a high priest&lt;sup id="fnref:frp"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:frp" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the Serbian Orthodox Church blamed it on Gay Pride. Because religion&lt;sup id="fnref:prayer"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:prayer" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a couple of minutes, please use &lt;a href="http://paypal.com"&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; to donate to floodrelief@gov.rs, the official account of the Serbian diplomatic mission in Brussels. If your bank allows international wire transfers, &lt;a href="http://www.redcross.org.rs/arhiva_Донације_2441"&gt;you can give directly to the Serbian Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;. While no one we know is affected, my grandparents had to leave their home twice over the past 50 years because of floods. The support they and their neighbors received from the Red Cross on both occasions was invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:ilic"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprise there. &lt;a href="http://srbin.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/velja-ilic-toma-je-cuvao-groblje-u-kragujevcu-on-je-bruka-za-srbiju-video.jpg"&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; is the head of Serbia's department for emergency response.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:ilic" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:prayer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I shouldn't be that sarcastic, since the Orthodox Church is, in fact, trying to help. &lt;a href="http://www.spc.rs/eng/prayer_supplication_cessation_rain_served"&gt;By praying for the rain to stop&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:prayer" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:frp"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't organized religion just an excuse for LARPing.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:frp" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2014 14:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-05-18:eng/2014/05/18/just-cant-get-a-break/</guid></item><item><title>A podcast a day</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2014/05/14/a-podcast-a-day/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: The average Maryland to DC commute is the second longest in the US, right after New York. I should know. Mine will be 90+ minutes, come July 1st. Last week, while I was finishing paperwork at my new employer's Bethesda offices, the looks people gave me went from incredulity to pity on seeing the Baltimore address on my driver's license and hearing my explanation that no, since my wife is still at Sinai and usually just walks to work, we won't move. It's better for me to take one for the team, I'd say, than have both of us suffer hellish beltway traffic from some midway point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write an essay on how &lt;em&gt;taking one for the team&lt;/em&gt; is not entirely true, but the title of this post says "podcast", and it's already the second paragraph, so here is my point: My commute will be long. I will need to fill that time with &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes, that will be strangers talking into my ear about things I don't understand. Here is my list of strangers, carefully curated after ten years of listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday: &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu"&gt;Mac Power Users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comes out every Monday morning, like clockwork. Great for learning about new hardware, productivity apps, etc. but podcasts are not the best medium for going into the minutia of somebody's workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday: &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w"&gt;Back to Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go &lt;a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/merlin-mann"&gt;read this&lt;/a&gt;. Having Merlin Mann talk for an hour all by himself would be good enough, but Dan Benjamin—the other half of BTW—is the best podcast host in &lt;em&gt;the business&lt;/em&gt;. By using &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cmaaarrr/status/466258733426020352"&gt;a simple formula&lt;/a&gt;, it is easy to mathematically prove that their show is the best podcast ever created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 30 or so minutes are laden with inside jokes and obscure references, but even that is fun after you are several episodes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday: &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/"&gt;Wait, wait…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It airs each Saturday, but I like alliteration, and there is nothing else good on Wednesdays. I was in Chicago once while it was being taped, but was too late to get a ticket. Now that &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/05/09/310749408/bye-carl-wait-wait-bids-farewell-to-our-official-judge-and-scorekeeper"&gt;Carl Kasell&lt;/a&gt; is retiring, it's unlikely I'll ever be at a live show. So it goes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thursday: &lt;a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/"&gt;The Talk Show&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net"&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt; is a better blog than TTS is a podcast—John Gruber and some of his guests tend to ramble—but you can get good insights on baseball and bourbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friday: &lt;a href="http://atp.fm"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word: &lt;a href="http://hypercritical.co"&gt;Siracusa&lt;/a&gt;. There are two other co-hosts, whose main job is not to screw up too badly. They do it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Saturday: &lt;a href="http://www.nerdist.com/podcast_channel/the-alton-browncast-channel/"&gt;The Alton Browncast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The John Siracusa-slash-&lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com"&gt;Bret Terpstra&lt;/a&gt; of food. Yes, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/462617590591156226"&gt;Alton Brown is a national treasure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Sunday potpourri&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the time for irregular shows, or ones that don't always have something of interest. In order of preference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radiolab.org"&gt;Radiolab&lt;/a&gt; • Fact: this is the best radio show ever created, and an even better podcast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/incomparable"&gt;The Incomparable&lt;/a&gt; • For geeks, by geeks. Or is it nerds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org"&gt;This American Life&lt;/a&gt; • Any co-production with Planet Money is a must-listen. Otherwise formulaic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic"&gt;Systematic&lt;/a&gt; • Hit-and-miss, though usually a hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://technicaldifficulties.us"&gt;Technical Difficulties&lt;/a&gt; • A tech DYI show with show notes better than some books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/cmdspace"&gt;CMD+Space&lt;/a&gt; • I only listen to it when an interesting guest is on, which is once every couple of months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/penaddict"&gt;The Pen Addict&lt;/a&gt; • A podcast about pens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://jop.ascopubs.org/site/podcasts/index.xhtml"&gt;JOP podcast&lt;/a&gt; • The only oncology podcast worth listening to; the medical podcast landscape is dreary.&lt;/li&gt;

Before you scream Embargo!, neither my wife nor I are American citizens. Our daughter is, but it is fortunately not illegal for US citizens to visit Cuba as long as they don't spend any money there, at least according to &lt;a href="http://www.travel.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/travel/cuba-doing-it-your-way.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;America's most esteemed journal of law, medicine and gastronomy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for whatever reason you want to travel to Cuba from the East coast, you might find our experience helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The flight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the United flight from Dulles to Cancun, went through Mexican customs and immigration, then took the Cubana flight to Havana after checking in again. Inbound, layover time was more than 3 hours so we could have comfortably checked a bag or two for those large bottles of sunscreen and other essential liquids. The trip back, however, was tight at 1h 55min, so we decided not to risk waisting time at baggage claim, and only brought carry-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it was half of a good move. On the way back, going through customs, immigration, then walking from Cancun's Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 and checking in for the flight to Dulles is barely manageable in those 90-ish minutes after leaving the plane. However, we could—and should—have checked one of the carry-ons on the inbound flight, as sunscreen, diaper cream, and other toiletries are ridiculously expensive in Havana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NB: You can easily walk from Cancun's Terminal 2 Arrivals to Terminal 3 Departures (or 3 -&amp;gt; 2 inbound). There is a shuttle that leaves every 30 minutes and goes Parking -&amp;gt; T1 -&amp;gt; T2 -&amp;gt; T3 -&amp;gt; Parking. The Cancun airport staff told us it would take us 25 minutes to walk from T2 to T3—and that it would take the shuttle at least as much since it makes those other stops—but hey! there's this van that magically appeared which would drive us to T3 for the low low price of $20. Google maps said it's less than a kilometer between terminals 2 and 3 so we smiled politely and walked away. It took us—three adults with a carry-on and a large shoulder bag each, plus a toddler in tow—less than 10 minutes. Kudos to United for letting us skip the long check-in line and making it to our flight without issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serbian citizens don't require a visa, but Dora had only her US passport. We got her a visa in Cancun at check-in for 20 euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuban entry stamp is bright pink. They asked us before putting one in Dora's passport, so I can only assume they occasionally get US citizens who'd rather not have their passports stamped for whatever reason (cough, cough). The visa also gets stamped, so there is still proof of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no issues going back through Dulles. The customs form asks you which countries you visited on the trip, so we did write we were in Cuba. The immigration officer at Dulles just asked if we were bringing any cigars back with us—of course not, we hadn't even smoked any while there!—and finished the fingerprinting in record time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring euros, and bring more than you expect. You can convert USD to convertible pesos (CUC) in any exchange office, but with their rates it's better to change dollars to euros in your own bank, then change euros to CUC once in Cuba. Also, convert some CUC to the &lt;em&gt;peso nacional&lt;/em&gt; (CUP), if only for the ridiculously cheap ice cream you can buy on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for how much to bring, count on &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; $20/person/day, not including the room or the 25 CUC exit tax. This would cover lunch, dinner, and a daily trip to the beach or a visit to a museum, monument, etc. Since you cannot use American credit/debit cards anywhere on the island, it pays to take more than you think you would need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Homestay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the trip! We booked &lt;a href="http://www.homestay.com/cuba/havana/4956-homestay-in-centro-habana-havana"&gt;this room&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://www.homestay.com"&gt;homestay.com&lt;/a&gt;, and could not be happier with how it turned out. Centro Habana, the neighborhood it's in, is definitely not for everyone—very safe, like the rest of Cuba, but also with dog poop and open trash cans everywhere you turn&lt;sup id="fnref:naples"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:naples" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Our &lt;em&gt;casa particular&lt;/em&gt; was the opposite—clean, well-maintained, gaudy, but cute. Between our large air-conditioned room, the patio, and the open rooftop terrace, we could easily have spent a couple of days just hanging out there chatting with the friendly hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't count on being able to get online at any point. We tried checking in online a day before the trip back, but none of the Havana Vieja hotels we tried had any prepaid cards available. Even if they had, there are no printers to print a boarding pass. Unless you're staying in a hotel, don't even think about wi-fi. Just bring a good book or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if someone's vacations response email tells you they're going to Cuba, don't count on them having any access, &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanleys-parker-on-email-access-2014-4"&gt;no matter what some self-important douche bag tells you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Guidebooks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only resource we used—and we used it multiple times per day—was the &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/havana-good-time/id385663683?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Havana Good Time iPhone app&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the information on working hours and prices is slightly outdated, but it is all still relevant, and it comes with an offline map of Havana that is—duh—much easier to carry around than the paper version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other DOs and DON'Ts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do take the Havana tour double decker bus at least once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do go to the Revolution Museum—the clunky propagandist English translations alone are worth the 8 CUC admission fee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do try the excellent Coppelito ice cream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't waste an hour standing in line to pay for it with CUP—support their economy, and pay for it in hard currency like the tourist you're pretending not to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't give any CUC to street performers, especially the kind that chases you down the street with a guitar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do throw CUP at them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't drink the tap water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could say the same about the part of Naples we stayed in this January. In fact, with laundry out in the open and being able to peek into people's living rooms from ground level it looked very much like Naples, just with wider streets.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:naples" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's doubly painful when I know I have institutional access via my library's proxy server, but have to jump through hoops to get it: go to the library website, log in, copy and paste the article name or PMID into its PubMed search box, and finally download the PDF. Arduous, and—turns out—unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://www.alfredapp.com"&gt;Alfred 2&lt;/a&gt; workflows. &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/634331"&gt;Here's a nice article&lt;/a&gt; I found on Twitter today. The NEJM link in the top right corner leads to an abstract, but I need a special archive subscription for the full PDF. No matter—I can just highlight the PMID and hit my special Alfred 2 keyboard combo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm not already logged into the Welch library proxy, I hit a login wall. It's nothing &lt;a href="http://1password.com"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; can't solve, but you can also just type in your username and password yourself, &lt;a href="http://skreened.com/unvisual/like-an-animal"&gt;like an animal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Bam! The ugly but magic button is where it should be. Your institution might have a prettier one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it clear—this simple workflow will do a PubMed search of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; selected text &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; in OS X, all through your institutional proxy server. Finding an interesting reference while reading an article, highlighting its title, and hitting ^⎇⌘P to get to the PDF always feels like magic.&lt;/p&gt;

You can disable this "feature" in the settings, but having it be opt-out shows yet again how little Google cares about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that there's anything wrong with that—privacy is a relatively modern invention that younger generations might not care for as much as we do. But you should understand the implications of patients and random strangers being able to leave messages in your personal inbox. Suing P.,,,,,,kmmmmmqmmmdoctors is &lt;a href="http://www.innovateus.net/content/medicine-code-hammurabi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a modern invention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I stopped using all Google services—search included—years ago. The company has become so large, with so many users, that it doesn't need to cater to fringe interests. And for a business with billions of users, doctors are a fringe group—one that hates &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution"&gt;change-for-change's-sake&lt;/a&gt;, having to [re-learn an interface][ n. Nnjm   interface] "just because", and not being &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/youre-not-googles-custome_b_841599.html"&gt;the true customer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:emr"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:emr" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the number of people at Google who may access my data is huge. &lt;a href="http://www.ownmail.net/?STKI=10207929"&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:referral"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:referral" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, my email provider of choice, has fewer than 10 employees. Gmail alone has hundreds. Not that anyone would be interested in me in particular, but if I ever inadvertently send or receive private patient information through my personal account, I'd rather as few people as possible see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email is fine, but why abandon search? First, I have googled enough ailments and substances, common and obscure, that the add network thought I was an elderly female recovering heroin addict with more than one &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia"&gt;paraphilia&lt;/a&gt;. The adds I would get were in that sense appropriate. Second, because of SEO the only valuable page-one results I would get were Wikipedia entries. Everything else was a hodgepodge of useless Livestrong, Huffington post and five-pages-per-500-word-article-AND-behind-a-login-wall Medscape links. &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com"&gt;Duckduckgo&lt;/a&gt; and, yes, &lt;a href="http://bing.com"&gt;Bing&lt;/a&gt; at least help with the first problem while not making the second one any worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google calendar is the only service I would consider using. It is fast, reliable, omnipresent and easy to use. There is, however, that constant nagging fear that they will find &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; way to integrate it with Google+ and yet again sacrifice functionality to force people into its circle&lt;sup id="fnref:heh"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:heh" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is why I use Apple's iCloud calendar, its horrendous web interface and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also: Reader. I use &lt;a href="https://feedwrangler.net/"&gt;FeedWrangler&lt;/a&gt; now, but &lt;em&gt;man&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors' concerns aside, Google is all set to become the network TV&lt;sup id="fnref:ms"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ms" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of the internet—large, bland, and largely not relevant to the people who are. It is already two-thirds of the way there.&lt;/p&gt;

It's been a while since I've read it, but the introduction reminded me of what I thought was its biggest fault in reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… But now many doctors admit that alternative medicine often seems to do a better job of making patients well, and at a much lower cost, than mainstream care—and they’re trying to learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative medicine does not make patients well. It makes them &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; well. The difference is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are two graphs from an excellent &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1103319#t=article"&gt;free-to-access NEJM article&lt;/a&gt; that compared four methods of treating asthma: conventional medicine, placebo, sham acupuncture, and doing nothing&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The first one shows how well the patients in each group &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; after 2-4 weeks of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah ha! Conventional medicine was no better than sham (&lt;em&gt;sham!&lt;/em&gt;) acupuncture, and both beat placebo inhalers. Alternative medicine wins! Or did conventional medicine lose? At the very least it's a draw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast. The second graphs shows the amount of objective improvement, measured in FEV1—the volume of air you exhale during the first second of breathing out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were the common cold, it wouldn't have been a big deal. But asthma is not the common cold. People die of it every day, not because they didn't feel well—though being unable to breathe is doubtlessly uncomfortable—but because their airways were too tight to get any air out of the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why alternative medicine can be dangerous in the wrong hands, with the wrong patient. Improving quality of life is important, but so is &lt;a href="http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2013/ReportNationDec2013Release"&gt;curing disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding real acupuncture to the interventions would have made the study perfect. Some other time, perhaps.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Every night, its army of gnomes will go over my tweets, blog posts, completed to-dos, etc. and record them in a &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id422304217?mt=12&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; journal entry. Not a replacement for a real journal, true, but better than anything I could do on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a Mac-only app that runs from the command line—not user friendly at all. Even so, the installation instructions are straightforward, with some caveats for the not-too-bright, like me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugin configuration is done in each individual &lt;em&gt;plugin&lt;/em&gt;.rb file, not slogger_config.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All config strings (URLs, file paths, usernames…) should be in quotes ("…"), even when in an array (i.e. in square brackets). The Twitter plugin instructions wrongly give an example without quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Instapaper plugin doesn't work since RSS feeds for folders are no longer supported. I'm still not switching to Pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need an &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt; account to log your Facebook posts, using &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/56242"&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://simplicitybliss.com/integrating-slogger-and-runkeeper/"&gt;Instructions for logging RunKeeper activity&lt;/a&gt; are convoluted, but work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slogger's default time for sucking in your data is 11:50pm, when my laptop is usually in sleep mode. The scheduler should still be smart enough to start the app on wake-up. Nevertheless, it's one more reason for me to get a used Mac Mini. In 2015, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 19:28:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2014-01-01:eng/2014/01/01/starting-the-new-year-with-slogger/</guid></item><item><title>Two podcasts, three doctors, one good show</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/29/two-podcasts-three-doctors-one-good-show/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In the last two months, two of my must-listen podcasts, &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic"&gt;Systematic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu"&gt;Mac Power User&lt;/a&gt;, have had medical professionals on as guests. I don't usually listen to medical podcasts—Twitter and saved PubMed searches are big enough firehoses—so I thought it would be interesting to hear how my more experienced colleagues use technology. Two of the three episodes were underwhelming, one was stellar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started with &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/69"&gt;Brett Terprstra and Dr. Pamela Peeke&lt;/a&gt; on Systematic. She has several books targeted towards lay public, and the episode went in the same vein—broad advice on nutrition, well-being, etc. I cringed more than once, but that was to be expected—public health information relies on overplaying the risks and simplifying facts to the point of absurdity&lt;sup id="fnref:forecasts"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:forecasts" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The one thing I could agree with was how important meditation can be, as mindful meditation might decrease physician burnout. Negative points for not mentioning &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0861719069/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0861719069&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20"&gt;Mindfulness in Plain English&lt;/a&gt; as essential reading, though I haven't read Dr. Peeke's own recommendation, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807012394/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0807012394&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20"&gt;The Miracle of Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had higher hopes for &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/169"&gt;Episode 169 of MPU&lt;/a&gt;, since Katie Floyd's and David Sparks's guest, Dr. Jeffrey Taekman, has &lt;a href="http://wippp.com/blog/"&gt;an excellent productivity blog&lt;/a&gt;. Alas, McSparky spent more than half of the show being fascinated by the minutiae of what doctors do. Which is better than what followed—long periods of uncomfortable silence while the unprepared guest clicked through every app in his menu bar to see if there is anything worth mentioning&lt;sup id="fnref:time"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:time" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. There wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then another episode of Systematic came on, &lt;a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/76"&gt;with Dr. Don Schaffner, a microbiologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:phd"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:phd" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was outstanding. Brett was a better interviewer than David, and avoided getting too side-tracked by his guest's interesting work. But ultimately, the show was good because Dr. Schaffner had useful tips and app recommendations that did not simply regurgitate the latest round of MPU/Mactories/Macdrifter/etc. sponsors. His paper review workflow gave me several ideas I will work on during the holiday downtime. He also suggested &lt;a href="http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/hf3.html"&gt;a promising contender&lt;/a&gt; in my quest to find headphones that will survive more than 8-12 months of intensive use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing for me to do during the downtime: promote &lt;a href="http://www.zotero.org"&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt;. Between &lt;a href="http://blog.macademic.org/2013/10/18/papers-3-a-step-in-the-wrong-direction/"&gt;the developers fumbling Papers 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/19/how-one-publisher-is-stopping-academics-from-sharing-their-research/"&gt;Mendeley being taken over by an evil corporation&lt;/a&gt;, Zotero coupled with a few extensions is the best reference manager on any platform. Coming in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="fn:forecasts"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like &lt;a href="http://www.bdkeller.com/2012/09/why-we-should-lie-about-the-weather-and-maybe-more/"&gt;weather forecasts&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:forecasts" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:time"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, it was not total silence. You could hear Katie fuming in the background.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:time" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:phd"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhD, not MD. Wonder if that explains why the show was better.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:phd" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don't feel comfortable doing that.&lt;/em&gt;—I don't know what you're asking me to do (nurse to intern); I'm too lazy to do it (intern to resident); I think it's a stupid idea and there's no way you can make me do it (resident to attending); You're not paying me enough to do this crap (attending to administration).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;It's a light elective&lt;/em&gt;—You don't need to show up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Needs to read more.&lt;/em&gt; (on a written evaluation)—I have no idea how much medicine this person knows. I barely know any myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The family is reasonable.&lt;/em&gt;—Family members don't ask too many questions and will agree with anything you say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patient has xyz&lt;/em&gt;.—I've read in an old discharge summary that the patient has &lt;em&gt;xyz&lt;/em&gt;, but have no idea how they established the diagnosis, what stage it is in, or what the hell &lt;em&gt;xyz&lt;/em&gt; even is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation. Sclearae are nonicteric.&lt;/em&gt;—If I were to report the physical exam I actually did it would take five nanoseconds, so take these fillers to make it seem like I've put in some effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you for the thorough presentation.&lt;/em&gt;—Why did you waste my time with all that useless information?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's an outpatient work-up.&lt;/em&gt;—Administration is already breathing down my neck because of this patient's length of stay and you're worried about a mild anemia and a positive hemoccult!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;That's her new baseline.&lt;/em&gt;—Her disease is worse and we don't know why, so I guess she's stuck with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please let me know if you have any more questions.&lt;/em&gt;—This is the end of our conversation, so please stop talking. I shall now leave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2013 13:52:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2013-12-25:eng/2013/12/25/ten-common-residency-idioms-and-phrases/</guid></item><item><title>As a one-time interviewer and two-time interviewee...</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/18/as-a-one-time-interviewer-and-two-time-interviewee/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thebiopsy.com/post/70322343598/entrepreneurialism-medical-school"&gt;…to me, this looks flaky&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, Scott Adams (of-Dilbert-fame) is right in saying &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846919/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1591846919&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=intern0cd-20"&gt;your best bet for success in life&lt;/a&gt; is being pretty good in several skills rather than trying to be the best ever in only one. So, a plan like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step one: become a decent entrepreneur&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step two: become a decent MD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step three: ???&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step four: profit!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;might indeed be a good idea. However:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine implies altruism. Entrepreneurship implies greed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programs want their residents to be 100% dedicated to medicine in general and the program in particular. Can you do that with a small business on the side?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physicians in academia, i.e. those who conduct residency interviews, forgo 300k+ salaries so they could dedicate themselves to research and education. Are you sure telling them about your latest money-making scheme is a good idea?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a resident, do you look at each patient as an opportunity to help them and learn from them, or to figure out how to build a business around them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residency programs exist to train physicians, not CEOs. Residency slots are already in short supply. Would program directors give a position to someone who is more likely to end up not practicing medicine at all?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2013 18:24:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2013-12-18:eng/2013/12/18/as-a-one-time-interviewer-and-two-time-interviewee/</guid></item><item><title>30 iPad apps I use almost every day</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/03/30-ipad-apps-i-use-almost-every-day/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After 18 months of intensive use, here are some of the apps left standing on my iPad 3, sorted by category. I like to think I'm a semi-advanced user, so for some of them I have also listed simpler alternatives. It goes without saying that you should download all the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/creativity-apps/ios/"&gt;free iWork and iLife apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medicine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MKSAP 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: all medicine residents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free (if you bought online MKSAP access)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MKSAP question bank. No-brainer if you are studying for your internal medicine board or MOC exam. Less page-flipping and instant gratification. Unfortunately, it doesn't allow you to highlighting or annotate the explanations. Also, it can't make custom quizzes, can't review unanswered/wrong questions, and doesn't allow you to copy any of the text to your notes. Lot's of cants, but it's the only MKSAP app available. Free if you purchase the electronic version of MKSAP 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mksap-16/id580511525?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download MKSAP 16 from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ACP Guidelines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: all interns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: ok, sort of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like a good idea, and the content is great, but it is more of a branded PDF reader than anything else. Doesn't have search or favorites, and you have to download each recommendation one by one. The download is fast, but good luck getting what you need without internet access. So, good for night-time reading, particularly if you're an intern, but not a good POC tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acp-clinical-guidelines/id618318388?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download ACP Guidelines from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stanford 25&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: just OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't heard of Stanford 25 before, see &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/abraham_verghese_a_doctor_s_touch.html"&gt;this TED talk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://stanford25blog.stanford.edu"&gt;see the blog&lt;/a&gt;. It's another good, if ugly, night table app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stanford-medicine-25/id556453964?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Stanford 25 from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Things for iPad (or Omnifocus)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $19.99 for Things, $39.99 for OmniFocus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt; fan or not, this or it's more powerful and more expensive sibling &lt;a href="http://macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/"&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt; are a must-have for anyone shuffling between more than two areas of responsibility. It still hasn't been updated for iOS 7, but is very functional. Only two missing features for me, really: there are no nested tasks/dependencies, and you can't filter by more than one tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about switching to OmniFocus, but this works well enough for me that the hassle of complete overhauling my system wouldn't be worth it. Not to mention the &amp;gt;100$ price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-for-ipad/id364365411?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Things for iPad from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-for-ipad/id383804552?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;You can find OmniFocus for iPad here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Boxer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone who gets more than 5 emails/day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $0.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best mail client on the iPad. Apple's Mail.app was OK until I realized I spent way too much time scrolling through my list of 20 IMAP folders whenever I wanted to move an email. Boxer works with Gmail, IMAP and Exchange accounts, has smart email sorting, and integrates with &lt;a href="http://www.sanebox.com"&gt;Sanebox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boxer-for-gmail-outlook-exchange/id561712083?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Boxer here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use Dropbox on your PC—and you must—then this is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Dropbox for iOS from the app store here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iThoughts HD&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: nerds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $9.99 for either&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="http://www.tonybuzan.com/about/mind-mapping/"&gt;Tony Buzan's book on mind mapping&lt;/a&gt; as a first-year medical student and used the hell out of it for my biophysics, chemistry and genetics coursers. As the material got more complicated, shuffling huge stacks of A3 paper became unwieldy, so I went back to plain old Cornell notes for biochemistry et al. This app is what got me back to making maps, this time when writing review articles and planning out other research. Also good when contemplating the GTD 50,000 ft view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ithoughtshd-mindmapping/id369020033?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download iThoughts HD for iPad from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt; It's prettier new cousin &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindnode/id312220102?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Mindnode 3 is available here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calendars 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: all busy overachievers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $6.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default calendar used to be ugly and impractical. With iOS 7 it's just the latter. This is a good replacement. Fantastical for iPad would be nice, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendars-5-smart-calendar/id697927927?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Calendars 5 from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drafts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: advanced users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $3.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick note-taking and automation rolled into one. I use it as the default inbox for anything and everything, mainly by appending a dump.txt file in my Dropbox. There is a separate iPhone version that is just as useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-for-ipad/id542797283?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Drafts for iPad from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pinner&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: pack-rats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $1.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://pinboard.in"&gt;Pinboard&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent almost-free bookmarking and discovery service. There are plenty of iPad clients available, but Pinner seemed to be the most cost-effective. I haven't regretted the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinner-social-bookmarking/id591613202?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Pinner from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GW Mail&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: anyone who is forced to use GroupWise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: meh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $9.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to use GroupWise email for work. This is the only decent client I found for iOS. Stopped looking for a replacement since my last day of residency is less than six months away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gw-mail/id335575354?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download GW Mail here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reeder 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: serious feed readers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using RSS feeds since the days of Bloglines (circa 2001) and switched to Google reader after the first big redesign. It's sad that Google decided to murder it instead developing its potential as a social service. &lt;a href="https://feedwrangler.net/"&gt;Feed wrangler&lt;/a&gt; is a good replacement, &lt;a href="http://feedly.com/index.html#welcome"&gt;Feedly&lt;/a&gt; is a free one. Reeder 2 is the best iPad feed reader there is, and works well with both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-2/id697846300?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Reeder for iPad from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Instapaper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone who reads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $3.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read any text that's longer than 500 words with any regularity, you need a service that will keep track of the articles and remove all the annoying cruft surrounding the text. &lt;a href="http://www.instapaper.com/"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; is the first one of its kind, and the best way to read articles on it is on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Instapaper for iOS from the app store here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;NextDraft&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten good articles hand-picked by an expert hand-picker and delivered (almost) every weekday. My only source of news for the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextdraft-days-most-fascinating/id549358690?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download NextDraft from the app store here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;ReadQuick&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: dabblers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second book from Tony Buzan that I read was on speed reading. This app will flash words from any article you find online or in your Instapaper/Pocket queue one-by-one at a set rate. Good for those who are too lazy to swipe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readquick-speed-reader-for/id515138359?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download ReadQuick from the app store here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journaling app. I don't use it for the Dear-Diary types of texts—though I have no doubt it would be perfect for that. Instead, I use it to keep an archive of meeting and lecture notes (usually started in Drafts and sent to Day One), with an occasional milestone in between. Feature request: multiple journals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal-diary/id421706526?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Day One for iOS from the app store here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Byword&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: beginner iPad writers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a long text on an iPad and don't need automation, text expansion et al. then this is the app for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8&amp;amp;at=1l3v3Zp"&gt;Download Byword for iOS from the app store here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editorial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: advanced users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: strong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $4.99&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a long text on an iPad and like mucking about with workflows, text snippets and Python scripts—which I most certainly do—this is your only choice on any platform. This will become essential next July when I start my long commute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Social&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Twitterific  5 or Tweetbot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For: everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommendation: meh… you might want to wait for the newest version of Tweetbot to come out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Price: $2.99 for Twitterrific, $2.99 for Tweetbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are on Twitter—and if you are a physician &lt;a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/04/twitter-doctors-guide-health-care-professionals.html"&gt;you really should be&lt;/a&gt;—please get a decent iOS client. The official one is definitely not it. Tweetbot used to be until iOS 7 came and made it look and feel ancient. Twitterrific is a good—if slightly annoying—substitute, with the added benefit of being universal (i.e. iPhone and iPad with the same purchase). I'm using the old version of Tweetbot and waiting for the new one, since Twitterific tended to make a mess of my position in the stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nominally, the lecture was about &lt;em&gt;RVUs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:rvu"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rvu" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. An accountant type in a pinstripe suit explained why the government came up with the concept and how more RVUs translate to mo' money for the hospital. Then he showed us a table. This is how much RVUs an average ophthalmologist makes in an hour. Here is an orthopedic surgeon. See here at the bottom? That's an internist. &lt;em&gt;This is how much you're worth to us, scum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:words"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:words" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there was a chart. This is the last fiscal year. This solid line here are monthly RVUs for an average hospitalist. The dotted line is for a single physician in the practice. See how it's always above the solid line? That's good. &lt;em&gt;We love that person&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had medical students and interns just three months into training listen to this. It was blood-curdling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not because the hospital organized the lecture, mind you. It is a very good thing they did it, and it is good for doctors in training to realize as early as possible in what kind of a healtcare system they are expected to work. What is frightening is that there needs to be an entity, let's call it &lt;em&gt;administration&lt;/em&gt;, which views the hospital as a production plant and physicians as line workers who need to &lt;em&gt;maximize outputs&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;optimize efficiencies&lt;/em&gt; and do other newspeak claptrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Administration usually lies—appropriately—on the ground floor, far removed from that other sausage factory of actual patient care. It looks at pie charts and histograms and RVU tables and keeps coming up with new and exciting ways to increase production while wondering why those bumbling doctors at the bottom of the list can't do whatever the top performing docs are doing to keep the hospital in the black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's modern medicine, it's complex, it's expensive, it requires that level of organization and detachment—you might be tempted to say. Yes, you could indeed say that, if not for the lonely example of &lt;em&gt;every other country in the developed world&lt;/em&gt; which does it differently than the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But never mind that. With all the shenanigans the Congress has been up to this week, that end of the equation is unlikely to change. What administrators should do—and I understand the banality of the following advice—is see real physicians interacting with real patients for at least and hour each week. Interns being bombarded by page after page—from critical to comical—while trying to figure out a 15-minute window to eat, get coffee and use the restroom&lt;sup id="fnref:wc"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wc" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Residents finishing a 24+ hour ICU shift that started with three codes and ended with a difficult end-of-life care discussion, with central lines placements and intern supervision—but no sleep—sprinkled in between. Attendings getting yelled at while trying to explain to family members why they need to pay for the medications out of pocket or bring their own&lt;sup id="fnref:obs"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:obs" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hour. Each week. Mandatory. To put things in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:rvu"&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2013 15:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2013-09-24:eng/2013/09/24/on-rvus-sort-of/</guid></item><item><title>On patient notes and busy interns</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2013/09/15/on-patient-notes-and-busy-interns/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Electronic patient notes, the way they stand now, are dangerous. As physicians wiser and more experienced than myself have noted, they are made for billing, not story-telling and communication between healthcare professionals; and as anyone with even basic literacy in the English language will notice as soon as they read one, they are a barely comprehensible, intelligible, muddled word salad that looks computer generated because, well, in most cases it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, they are ridiculously easy to create. Click on a checkbox and every admission note you start will come pre-populated with what the EMR &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; are the patient's current home medications, prior surgical procedures and such. Have trouble accurately documenting the dozen medications your 72-year-old with systolic heart failure, diabetes, CKD and vascular dementia has? No big deal—the e-patient has at least &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; listed from an ER visit 9 months ago. You'll make sure to go back to the admission note later and append it with the correct list when you get it from the family member tomorrow, right? &lt;em&gt;Right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also save you from having to type. &lt;em&gt;Click click click&lt;/em&gt;, and the review of systems is done. Too much clicking? There is a solution: spend 5 minutes to create a macro, and you will have all your common questions pre-answered as &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt; on all the notes, shaving of &lt;em&gt;seconds&lt;/em&gt; of additional clicking. Because asking all your patients the same questions and expecting identical answers is just plain common sense, amiright? Oh, and of course tachycardia is a symptom. It's right there on the ROS list, waiting to be clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, electronic notes are the one cure for writer's block. While in the distant past&lt;sup id="fnref:sinainotes"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sinainotes" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; you had to spend agonizing minutes staring at a blank admission note trying to form a coherent story on why the patient came to be seen, and then try putting it down on paper down without feeling ashamed, you learn from EMR that it is OK to sign a medico-legal document that contains this brilliant turn of phrase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for visit is: pt missed hd, high bp, n/v. The course was: constant. The exacerbating factor was: none. The alleviating factor was: none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;? Medicine residents are, in general, all moderately-to-ridiculosuly smart and ambitious people who should know better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for starters, some of them don't. Even in the olden days&lt;sup id="fnref:sinainotes"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sinainotes" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; you had a couple of interns who weren't the best ever history-takers&lt;sup id="fnref:historians"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:historians" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and wrote poor-quality notes. Electronic notes, unfortunately, help them obfuscate their deficiencies. It is very easy to see in a one-page note how much useful information the resident has actually obtained. Not so much with computer-generated six-pagers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is your typical smart intern just finishing putting in orders for her fourth admission admission that day after discussing each one with the supervising resident, all while answering a barrage of pages about the 30 patients she is cross-covering. The first two admission notes are almost done—she has to updated the plan after talking with the resident—but the other two will have to wait until she updates the sign-out and hands off all the patients to the night float. This is arguably much more important than notes as it directly affects the care those newly admitted patients will get overnight, while the admission note is not really needed until the following day during morning rounds. She's smart enough to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's also smart enough to know what is expected of her. What she know about writing admission notes during residency she learned from her peers, particularly seniors—who concentrated on &lt;em&gt;efficiency&lt;/em&gt; —and that lady at the billing department who gave a noon conference talk on the importance of &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; documentation for coding. So The Man wants me to be efficient-yet-thorough, and then he gives me this electronic tool with auto-population, templates, macros and such. &lt;em&gt;Hmmmmm&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, she might get in trouble if her notes are so horrendously bad to significantly impede patient care. From my very limited experience this just does not happen. Or rather, if it does, appropriate documentation is a single bullet in the long list of areas of improvement during an M&amp;amp;M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:sinainotes"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in my program, six months ago.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sinainotes" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fn:historians"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They would be the ones calling the patient "a poor historian", and were usually correct, although not in the way they intended. Patients are the ones giving a (hi)story, the &lt;em&gt;physician&lt;/em&gt; is the historian.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:historians" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be worse to get a consult at 4 in the morning, you ask?

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Miloš Miljković</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:miljko.org,2013-02-27:eng/2013/02/27/no-more-excuses/</guid></item><item><title>Peeves</title><link>http://miljko.org/eng/2012/12/02/peeves/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I don't care much for spelling or grammar. My native language, Serbian, has no concept of the former thanks to its being phonetic. As for the latter, few people in my home town and the surrounding area cared too much about it, flinging tenses, forms and declinations around carelessly. I proudly continue this tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gets to me is semantics. Misspelling tachypnoeic is unfortunate; saying that the patient's head is normocephalic means either that it had grown a head of its own, or that the speaker had no idea what the word they were using signified&lt;sup id="fnref:1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, lots of big words and a sizable footnote just to introduce something I'll likely be doing on a weekly basis---complaining about today's youth and their improper use of medical verbiage&lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="footnote"&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
