		<p><a href="http://www.thebiopsy.com/post/70322343598/entrepreneurialism-medical-school">…to me, this looks flaky</a>. Yes, Scott Adams (of-Dilbert-fame) is right in saying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846919/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591846919&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=intern0cd-20">your best bet for success in life</a> is being pretty good in several skills rather than trying to be the best ever in only one. So, a plan like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Step one: become a decent entrepreneur</li>
<li>Step two: become a decent MD</li>
<li>Step three: ???</li>
<li>Step four: profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>might indeed be a good idea. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicine implies altruism. Entrepreneurship implies greed.</li>
<li>Programs want their residents to be 100% dedicated to medicine in general and the program in particular. Can you do that with a small business on the side?</li>
<li>Physicians in academia, i.e. those who conduct residency interviews, forgo 300k+ salaries so they could dedicate themselves to research and education. Are you sure telling them about your latest money-making scheme is a good idea?</li>
<li>As a resident, do you look at each patient as an opportunity to help them and learn from them, or to figure out how to build a business around them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Residency programs exist to train physicians, not CEOs. Residency slots are already in short supply. Would program directors give a position to someone who is more likely to end up not practicing medicine at all?</p>
