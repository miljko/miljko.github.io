        <meta name="description" content="For better or worse, the American system of government is strong. Those who say otherwise have a financial interest in people thinking the opposite. Culturally, US has more similarities with Iran than with Saudi Arabia, even if you count religion and religiosity as part of culture. The Christian right is working hard to make them even more similar. Though still quite hard, it’s easier for a high-skilled immigrant to come to America than to any other country in the world. Comparison is even more favorable for low-skilled and unskilled immigrants. For all of them, quality of life, acceptance, and protection they get are better than anywhere else. The randomness of the Green Card lottery process is a feature not a bug. Reading the non-fiction sections of The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and whatever their conservative equivalents are, is good for generating fake insight but ultimately pointless. The Economist is useful for a tiny segment of the population but lets be real: if you’re reading this you are not it. The only useful section in the daily newspapers is Local. Maybe Sports, if you are into that sort of thing, but professional and college sports are a scam so stick with the amateur leagues. TSA agents and airline personnel are nice people but some passengers check out their brains at the curb and make everyone’s lives less pleasant. Apple hardware products are underpriced for what you get but do you actually need what they offer? This doesn’t include the AirPods, which are the best thing Apple has made in the last 20 years and still underpriced; though they unfortunately resemble in both name and appearance a mind control method from Doctor Who S2 and paired with a smart phone are not far from it. The world doesn’t need another IPA. America needs more tripels. This is all coming from a non-immigrant resident alien with no expertise in politics, international law, transportation, or technology. I do know beer though." />
