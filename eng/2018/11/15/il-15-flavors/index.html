        <meta name="description" content="One thing I realized at SITC this year was that not many people know (or care?) about the difference between the IL-15s now being tested in trials. There are: the recombinant human (rh)IL-15, the IL-15/IL-15Ralpha heterodimer (hetIL-15), and ALT-803, the “super-agonist”. You’re better of reading a more comprehensive review, but some highlights are below. The simplest, oldest, and seemingly most potent is the plain vanilla rhIL-15. Four dosing strategies have so far been tested: bolus (too toxic, published), subcutaneous (OK, about as good as ALT-803 in increasing NKs and CD8+ T cells, also published), 10-day continuous infusion (the most potent, but who wants to sit in a hospital for 10 days, should be published soon), and a 5-day infusion (same 40-fold increase in NK numbers in half the time! presented at SITC) None of the patients in any of the regimens had a RECIST response, but most mounted an impressive lymphocytosis, leading to several planned combination trials It is available for investigator-initiated studies through CTEP. They will also give a few vials for preclinical studies. Novartis owns hetIL-15, and is running the phase I alone and in combination with their anti-PD-1. Nothing published, but I’ll have more to say about it next year. ALT-803 is an IL-15/IL-15Ralpha heterodimer blessed with a single point mutation which confers upon it both increased binding to the common gamma chain, and validity to the claim of new IP. It is the only one shown to have efficacy as a single agent (though not in solid tumors), and the only one to be part of a published and/or presented combination (with nivolumab in NSCLC, and with rituximab in FL). What’s presented so far makes it less potent than rhIL-15 in increasing cell counts, but more convenient to give: via once-weekly subcutaneous injections for an 8-fold increase in NKs. The company, Altor Biosciences, had been fairly open to IITs — one of them is currently open at NCI’s GU Malignancies Branch — but maybe not so much since being acquired in August 2018 by NantCell, a Patrick Soon-Shiong company. There’s more, of course, but I’ll end instead with another plug for our review of cytokines in cancer therapy." />
