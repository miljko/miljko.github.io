		<p>Four years ago today was my first day as an intern at Sinai. Yesterday was my last on Sinai's payroll. I will miss it.</p>
<p>Won't miss the fake flash mobs of Lifebridge Health, though.</p>
<h1>Excluded</h1>
<p>After a year of being one of the program's two Chief residents, I cannot listen to anyone talking positively about Sinai without retorting with a list of reasons why that aspect is not so good, actually, and here are the ways it can be improved, and the reasons why it probably won't work. Similarly, for any complaint about the program I have a list of reasons why it is not valid and what was unsuccessfully tried in the past to change it.</p>
<p>Baltimore has 12 internal medicine residency programs. Sinai's is the third largest, and the largest one that is community-based. Its residents don't appreciate this until they have to rotate in a large university hospital—why is there so little supervision? the nurses don't draw stat labs?! why are there different surgical consult services for each six feet of the intestine?</p>
<p>Yes, that is an exaggeration. Once you get used to a system—especially an archaic collection of hospital policies with 50-plus years of accumulated cruft—having to adapt to a different set of ways-of-doing-things will be traumatic.</p>
<p>Which is to say, I might have a better understanding of the program than most residents, and not a single reason to hold back from sharing it with everyone.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful university-affiliated program with a ridiculously receptive and accommodating management. There are very few issues, and the PDs and current Chiefs are actively working on them. If you are smart enough to graduate from med school and don't have a serious personality disorder, you</p>
