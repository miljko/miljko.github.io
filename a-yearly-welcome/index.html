        <meta name="description" content="July 1st is when most US residency programs let their new interns loose after a week of corporate compliance training and ACGME-mandated talks about burnout. If you are a medical student or a new intern, read this. And this short post of mine still applies. In addition, remember that it is easy to become very cynical very quickly. That is not the best of defense mechanisms, but it is better than substance abuse, domestic violence, or suicidal ideation. So, if you have to be cynical, do it up the chain of command, not down or laterally. That way you will avoid preconditioning medical students, observers, and your fellow interns. The senior residents will either support you in your jadedness, or will get to feel smug when they tell you that you are too young for that much cynicism. Your attendings should, ideally, teach you why you are wrong—though the younger they are the more likely it is they will behave like senior residents. So it’s a win for everyone, really, unless someone dings you for lack of professionalism. Also, please remember to eat." />

<p>In addition, remember that it is easy to become very cynical very quickly.
That is not the best of defense mechanisms, but it is better than substance
abuse, domestic violence, or suicidal ideation. So, if you <em>have to</em> be
cynical, do it <em>up</em> the chain of command, not down or laterally. That
way you will avoid preconditioning medical students, observers, and your
fellow interns. The senior residents will either support you in your
jadedness, or will get to feel smug when they tell you that you are too
young for that much cynicism. Your attendings should, ideally, teach you
why you are wrong—though the younger they are the more likely it is they
will behave like senior residents. So it&#8217;s a win for everyone, really, unless
someone dings you for lack of&nbsp;professionalism.</p>
