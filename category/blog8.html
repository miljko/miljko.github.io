                <div class="summary"><ul>
<li><em>I don&#8217;t feel comfortable doing that.</em>—I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re asking me to do (nurse to intern); I&#8217;m too lazy to do it (intern to resident); I think it&#8217;s a stupid idea and there&#8217;s no way you can make me do it (resident to attending); You&#8217;re not paying me enough to do this crap (attending to&nbsp;administration).</li>
<li><em>It&#8217;s a light elective</em>—You don&#8217;t need to show&nbsp;up.</li>
<li><em>Needs to read more.</em> (on a written evaluation)—I have no idea how much medicine this person knows. I barely know any&nbsp;myself.</li>
<li><em>The family is reasonable.</em>—Family members don&#8217;t ask too many questions and will agree with anything you&nbsp;say.</li>
<li><em>The patient has xyz</em>.—I&#8217;ve read in an old discharge summary that the patient has <em>xyz</em>, but have no idea how they established the diagnosis, what stage it is in, or what the hell <em>xyz</em> even&nbsp;is.</li>
<li><em>The head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation. Sclearae are nonicteric.</em>—If I were to report the physical exam I actually did it would take five nanoseconds, so take these fillers to make it seem like I&#8217;ve put in some&nbsp;effort.</li>
<li><em>Thank you for the thorough presentation.</em>—Why did you waste my time with all that useless&nbsp;information?</li>
<li><em>That&#8217;s an outpatient work-up.</em>—Administration is already breathing down my neck because of this patient&#8217;s length of stay and you&#8217;re worried about a mild anemia and a positive&nbsp;hemoccult!?</li>
<li><em>That&#8217;s her new baseline.</em>—Her disease is worse and we don&#8217;t know why, so I guess she&#8217;s stuck with&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><em>Please let me know if you have any more questions.</em>—This is the end of our conversation, so please stop talking. I shall now&nbsp;leave.</li>

                <div class="summary"><p><a href="http://www.thebiopsy.com/post/70322343598/entrepreneurialism-medical-school">…to me, this looks flaky</a>. Yes, Scott Adams (of-Dilbert-fame) is right in saying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846919/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591846919&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=intern0cd-20">your best bet for success in life</a> is being pretty good in several skills rather than trying to be the best ever in only one. So, a plan like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Step one: become a decent&nbsp;entrepreneur</li>
<li>Step two: become a decent <span class="caps">MD</span></li>
<li>Step three:&nbsp;???</li>
<li>Step four:&nbsp;profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>might indeed be a good idea.&nbsp;However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicine implies altruism. Entrepreneurship implies&nbsp;greed.</li>
<li>Programs want their residents to be 100% dedicated to medicine in general and the program in particular. Can you do that with a small business on the&nbsp;side?</li>
<li>Physicians in academia, i.e. those who conduct residency interviews, forgo 300k+ salaries so they could dedicate themselves to research and education. Are you sure telling them about your latest money-making scheme is a good&nbsp;idea?</li>
<li>As a resident, do you look at each patient as an opportunity to help them and learn from them, or to figure out how to build a business around&nbsp;them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Residency programs exist to train physicians, not CEOs. Residency slots are already in short supply. Would program directors give a position to someone who is more likely to end up not practicing medicine at&nbsp;all?</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>After 18 months of intensive use, here are some of the apps left standing on my iPad 3, sorted by category. I like to think I&#8217;m a semi-advanced user, so for some of them I have also listed simpler alternatives. It goes without saying that you should download all the <a href="http://www.apple.com/creativity-apps/ios/">free iWork and iLife apps</a>.</p>
<h2>Medicine</h2>
<h3><span class="caps">MKSAP</span>&nbsp;16</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: all medicine&nbsp;residents</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price: free (if you bought online <span class="caps">MKSAP</span>&nbsp;access)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">MKSAP</span> question bank. No-brainer if you are studying for your internal medicine board or <span class="caps">MOC</span> exam. Less page-flipping and instant gratification. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t allow you to highlighting or annotate the explanations. Also, it can&#8217;t make custom quizzes, can&#8217;t review unanswered/wrong questions, and doesn&#8217;t allow you to copy any of the text to your notes. Lot&#8217;s of cants, but it&#8217;s the only <span class="caps">MKSAP</span> app available. Free if you purchase the electronic version of <span class="caps">MKSAP</span>&nbsp;16.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mksap-16/id580511525?mt=8&amp;at=1l3v3Zp">Download <span class="caps">MKSAP</span> 16 from the app store&nbsp;here.</a></p>
<h3><span class="caps">ACP</span>&nbsp;Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: all&nbsp;interns</li>
<li>Recommendation: ok, sort&nbsp;of</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like a good idea, and the content is great, but it is more of a branded <span class="caps">PDF</span> reader than anything else. Doesn&#8217;t have search or favorites, and you have to download each recommendation one by one. The download is fast, but good luck getting what you need without internet access. So, good for night-time reading, particularly if you&#8217;re an intern, but not a good <span class="caps">POC</span>&nbsp;tool.</p>

<h3>Stanford&nbsp;25</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation: just <span class="caps">OK</span></li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of Stanford 25 before, see <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/abraham_verghese_a_doctor_s_touch.html">this <span class="caps">TED</span> talk</a> and <a href="http://stanford25blog.stanford.edu">see the blog</a>. It&#8217;s another good, if ugly, night table&nbsp;app.</p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>
<h3>Things for iPad (or&nbsp;Omnifocus)</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price: $19.99 for Things, $39.99 for&nbsp;OmniFocus</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"><span class="caps">GTD</span></a> fan or not, this or it&#8217;s more powerful and more expensive sibling <a href="http://macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/">OmniFocus</a> are a must-have for anyone shuffling between more than two areas of responsibility. It still hasn&#8217;t been updated for iOS 7, but is very functional. Only two missing features for me, really: there are no nested tasks/dependencies, and you can&#8217;t filter by more than one&nbsp;tag.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about switching to OmniFocus, but this works well enough for me that the hassle of complete overhauling my system wouldn&#8217;t be worth it. Not to mention the &gt;100$ price&nbsp;tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-for-ipad/id364365411?mt=8&amp;at=1l3v3Zp">Download Things for iPad from the app store here.</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-for-ipad/id383804552?mt=8&amp;at=1l3v3Zp">You can find OmniFocus for iPad&nbsp;here.</a></p>
<h3>Boxer</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: everyone who gets more than 5&nbsp;emails/day</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$0.99</li>
</ul>
<p>The best mail client on the iPad. Apple&#8217;s Mail.app was <span class="caps">OK</span> until I realized I spent way too much time scrolling through my list of 20 <span class="caps">IMAP</span> folders whenever I wanted to move an email. Boxer works with Gmail, <span class="caps">IMAP</span> and Exchange accounts, has smart email sorting, and integrates with <a href="http://www.sanebox.com">Sanebox</a>.</p>

<h3>Dropbox</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use Dropbox on your <span class="caps">PC</span>—and you must—then this is a&nbsp;no-brainer.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330?mt=8&amp;at=1l3v3Zp">Download Dropbox for iOS from the app store&nbsp;here</a></p>
<h3>iThoughts <span class="caps">HD</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;nerds</li>
<li>Recommendation: <span class="caps">OK</span></li>
<li>Price: $9.99 for&nbsp;either</li>
</ul>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.tonybuzan.com/about/mind-mapping/">Tony Buzan&#8217;s book on mind mapping</a> as a first-year medical student and used the hell out of it for my biophysics, chemistry and genetics coursers. As the material got more complicated, shuffling huge stacks of A3 paper became unwieldy, so I went back to plain old Cornell notes for biochemistry et al. This app is what got me back to making maps, this time when writing review articles and planning out other research. Also good when contemplating the <span class="caps">GTD</span> 50,000 ft&nbsp;view.</p>

<h3>Calendars&nbsp;5</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: all busy&nbsp;overachievers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$6.99</li>
</ul>
<p>The default calendar used to be ugly and impractical. With iOS 7 it&#8217;s just the latter. This is a good replacement. Fantastical for iPad would be nice,&nbsp;though.</p>

<h3>Drafts</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: advanced&nbsp;users</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$3.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick note-taking and automation rolled into one. I use it as the default inbox for anything and everything, mainly by appending a dump.txt file in my Dropbox. There is a separate iPhone version that is just as&nbsp;useful.</p>

<h3>Pinner</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;pack-rats</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$1.99</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> is an excellent almost-free bookmarking and discovery service. There are plenty of iPad clients available, but Pinner seemed to be the most cost-effective. I haven&#8217;t regretted the&nbsp;purchase.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">GW</span>&nbsp;Mail</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: anyone who is forced to use&nbsp;GroupWise</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;meh</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$9.99</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to use GroupWise email for work. This is the only decent client I found for iOS. Stopped looking for a replacement since my last day of residency is less than six months&nbsp;away.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<h3>Reeder&nbsp;2</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: serious feed&nbsp;readers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds since the days of Bloglines (circa 2001) and switched to Google reader after the first big redesign. It&#8217;s sad that Google decided to murder it instead developing its potential as a social service. <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/">Feed wrangler</a> is a good replacement, <a href="http://feedly.com/index.html#welcome">Feedly</a> is a free one. Reeder 2 is the best iPad feed reader there is, and works well with&nbsp;both.</p>

<h3>Instapaper</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: everyone who&nbsp;reads</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$3.99</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read any text that&#8217;s longer than 500 words with any regularity, you need a service that will keep track of the articles and remove all the annoying cruft surrounding the text. <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> is the first one of its kind, and the best way to read articles on it is on an&nbsp;iPad.</p>

<h3>NextDraft</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>Ten good articles hand-picked by an expert hand-picker and delivered (almost) every weekday. My only source of news for the past six&nbsp;months.</p>

<h3>ReadQuick</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;dabblers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>The second book from Tony Buzan that I read was on speed reading. This app will flash words from any article you find online or in your Instapaper/Pocket queue one-by-one at a set rate. Good for those who are too lazy to&nbsp;swipe.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<h3>Day&nbsp;One</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>A journaling app. I don&#8217;t use it for the Dear-Diary types of texts—though I have no doubt it would be perfect for that. Instead, I use it to keep an archive of meeting and lecture notes (usually started in Drafts and sent to Day One), with an occasional milestone in between. Feature request: multiple&nbsp;journals.</p>

<h3>Byword</h3>

<li>For: beginner iPad&nbsp;writers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to write a long text on an iPad and don&#8217;t need automation, text expansion et al. then this is the app for&nbsp;you.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: advanced&nbsp;users</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to write a long text on an iPad and like mucking about with workflows, text snippets and Python scripts—which I most certainly do—this is your only choice on any platform. This will become essential next July when I start my long&nbsp;commute.</p>

<h2>Social</h2>
<h3>Twitterific  5 or&nbsp;Tweetbot</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation: meh… you might want to wait for the newest version of Tweetbot to come&nbsp;out</li>
<li>Price: $2.99 for Twitterrific, $2.99 for&nbsp;Tweetbot</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are on Twitter—and if you are a physician <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/04/twitter-doctors-guide-health-care-professionals.html">you really should be</a>—please get a decent iOS client. The official one is definitely not it. Tweetbot used to be until iOS 7 came and made it look and feel ancient. Twitterrific is a good—if slightly annoying—substitute, with the added benefit of being universal (i.e. iPhone and iPad with the same purchase). I&#8217;m using the old version of Tweetbot and waiting for the new one, since Twitterific tended to make a mess of my position in the&nbsp;stream.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/on-rvus-sort-of/">On RVUs, sort&nbsp;of</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>They let us peek into the sausage factory last&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>Nominally, the lecture was about <em>RVUs</em><sup id="fnref:rvu"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rvu" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. An accountant type in a pinstripe suit explained why the government came up with the concept and how more RVUs translate to mo&#8217; money for the hospital. Then he showed us a table. This is how much RVUs an average ophthalmologist makes in an hour. Here is an orthopedic surgeon. See here at the bottom? That&#8217;s an internist. <em>This is how much you&#8217;re worth to us, scum</em><sup id="fnref:words"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:words" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Then there was a chart. This is the last fiscal year. This solid line here are monthly RVUs for an average hospitalist. The dotted line is for a single physician in the practice. See how it&#8217;s always above the solid line? That&#8217;s good. <em>We love that person</em>.</p>
<p>We had medical students and interns just three months into training listen to this. It was&nbsp;blood-curdling.</p>
<p>Not because the hospital organized the lecture, mind you. It is a very good thing they did it, and it is good for doctors in training to realize as early as possible in what kind of a healtcare system they are expected to work. What is frightening is that there needs to be an entity, let&#8217;s call it <em>administration</em>, which views the hospital as a production plant and physicians as line workers who need to <em>maximize outputs</em>, <em>optimize efficiencies</em> and do other newspeak&nbsp;claptrap.</p>
<p>Administration usually lies—appropriately—on the ground floor, far removed from that other sausage factory of actual patient care. It looks at pie charts and histograms and <span class="caps">RVU</span> tables and keeps coming up with new and exciting ways to increase production while wondering why those bumbling doctors at the bottom of the list can&#8217;t do whatever the top performing docs are doing to keep the hospital in the&nbsp;black.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s modern medicine, it&#8217;s complex, it&#8217;s expensive, it requires that level of organization and detachment—you might be tempted to say. Yes, you could indeed say that, if not for the lonely example of <em>every other country in the developed world</em> which does it differently than the <span class="caps">US</span>.</p>
<p>But never mind that. With all the shenanigans the Congress has been up to this week, that end of the equation is unlikely to change. What administrators should do—and I understand the banality of the following advice—is see real physicians interacting with real patients for at least and hour each week. Interns being bombarded by page after page—from critical to comical—while trying to figure out a 15-minute window to eat, get coffee and use the restroom<sup id="fnref:wc"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wc" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Residents finishing a 24+ hour <span class="caps">ICU</span> shift that started with three codes and ended with a difficult end-of-life care discussion, with central lines placements and intern supervision—but no sleep—sprinkled in between. Attendings getting yelled at while trying to explain to family members why they need to pay for the medications out of pocket or bring their own<sup id="fnref:obs"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:obs" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>One hour. Each week. Mandatory. To put things in&nbsp;perspective.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/on-patient-notes-and-busy-interns/">On patient notes and busy&nbsp;interns</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>Electronic patient notes, the way they stand now, are dangerous. As physicians wiser and more experienced than myself have noted, they are made for billing, not story-telling and communication between healthcare professionals; and as anyone with even basic literacy in the English language will notice as soon as they read one, they are a barely comprehensible, intelligible, muddled word salad that looks computer generated because, well, in most cases it&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>For one, they are ridiculously easy to create. Click on a checkbox and every admission note you start will come pre-populated with what the <span class="caps">EMR</span> <em>thinks</em> are the patient&#8217;s current home medications, prior surgical procedures and such. Have trouble accurately documenting the dozen medications your 72-year-old with systolic heart failure, diabetes, <span class="caps">CKD</span> and vascular dementia has? No big deal—the e-patient has at least <em>something</em> listed from an <span class="caps">ER</span> visit 9 months ago. You&#8217;ll make sure to go back to the admission note later and append it with the correct list when you get it from the family member tomorrow, right? <em>Right.</em></p>
<p>They also save you from having to type. <em>Click click click</em>, and the review of systems is done. Too much clicking? There is a solution: spend 5 minutes to create a macro, and you will have all your common questions pre-answered as <em>No</em> on all the notes, shaving of <em>seconds</em> of additional clicking. Because asking all your patients the same questions and expecting identical answers is just plain common sense, amiright? Oh, and of course tachycardia is a symptom. It&#8217;s right there on the <span class="caps">ROS</span> list, waiting to be&nbsp;clicked.</p>
<p>Most of all, electronic notes are the one cure for writer&#8217;s block. While in the distant past<sup id="fnref:sinainotes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sinainotes" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> you had to spend agonizing minutes staring at a blank admission note trying to form a coherent story on why the patient came to be seen, and then try putting it down on paper down without feeling ashamed, you learn from <span class="caps">EMR</span> that it is <span class="caps">OK</span> to sign a medico-legal document that contains this brilliant turn of&nbsp;phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason for visit is: pt missed hd, high bp, n/v. The course was: constant. The exacerbating factor was: none. The alleviating factor was:&nbsp;none.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But <em>why</em>? Medicine residents are, in general, all moderately-to-ridiculosuly smart and ambitious people who should know&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Well, for starters, some of them don&#8217;t. Even in the olden days<sup id="fnref2:sinainotes"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sinainotes" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> you had a couple of interns who weren&#8217;t the best ever history-takers<sup id="fnref:historians"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:historians" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and wrote poor-quality notes. Electronic notes, unfortunately, help them obfuscate their deficiencies. It is very easy to see in a one-page note how much useful information the resident has actually obtained. Not so much with computer-generated&nbsp;six-pagers.</p>
<p>Then there is your typical smart intern just finishing putting in orders for her fourth admission admission that day after discussing each one with the supervising resident, all while answering a barrage of pages about the 30 patients she is cross-covering. The first two admission notes are almost done—she has to updated the plan after talking with the resident—but the other two will have to wait until she updates the sign-out and hands off all the patients to the night float. This is arguably much more important than notes as it directly affects the care those newly admitted patients will get overnight, while the admission note is not really needed until the following day during morning rounds. She&#8217;s smart enough to&nbsp;prioritize.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also smart enough to know what is expected of her. What she know about writing admission notes during residency she learned from her peers, particularly seniors—who concentrated on <em>efficiency</em> —and that lady at the billing department who gave a noon conference talk on the importance of <em>complete</em> documentation for coding. So The Man wants me to be efficient-yet-thorough, and then he gives me this electronic tool with auto-population, templates, macros and such. <em>Hmmmmm</em>…</p>
<p>Yes, she might get in trouble if her notes are so horrendously bad to significantly impede patient care. From my very limited experience this just does not happen. Or rather, if it does, appropriate documentation is a single bullet in the long list of areas of improvement during an&nbsp;M&amp;M.</p>

<p>What gets to me is semantics.
