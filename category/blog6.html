                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/05/14/a-podcast-a-day/">A podcast a&nbsp;day</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>Fun fact: The average Maryland to <span class="caps">DC</span> commute is the second longest in the <span class="caps">US</span>, right after New York. I should know. Mine will be 90+ minutes, come July 1st. Last week, while I was finishing paperwork at my new employer&#8217;s Bethesda offices, the looks people gave me went from incredulity to pity on seeing the Baltimore address on my driver&#8217;s license and hearing my explanation that no, since my wife is still at Sinai and usually just walks to work, we won&#8217;t move. It&#8217;s better for me to take one for the team, I&#8217;d say, than have both of us suffer hellish beltway traffic from some midway&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>I could write an essay on how <em>taking one for the team</em> is not entirely true, but the title of this post says &#8220;podcast&#8221;, and it&#8217;s already the second paragraph, so here is my point: My commute will be long. I will need to fill that time with <em>something</em>. Sometimes, that will be strangers talking into my ear about things I don&#8217;t understand. Here is my list of strangers, carefully curated after ten years of&nbsp;listening.</p>
<h2>Monday: <a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power&nbsp;Users</a></h2>
<p>Comes out every Monday morning, like clockwork. Great for learning about new hardware, productivity apps, etc. but podcasts are not the best medium for going into the minutia of somebody&#8217;s&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<h2>Tuesday: <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to&nbsp;Work</a></h2>
<p>Go <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/merlin-mann">read this</a>. Having Merlin Mann talk for an hour all by himself would be good enough, but Dan Benjamin—the other half of <span class="caps">BTW</span>—is the best podcast host in <em>the business</em>. By using <a href="https://twitter.com/Cmaaarrr/status/466258733426020352">a simple formula</a>, it is easy to mathematically prove that their show is the best podcast ever&nbsp;created.</p>
<p>The first 30 or so minutes are laden with inside jokes and obscure references, but even that is fun after you are several episodes&nbsp;in.</p>
<h2>Wednesday: <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/">Wait,&nbsp;wait…</a></h2>
<p>It airs each Saturday, but I like alliteration, and there is nothing else good on Wednesdays. I was in Chicago once while it was being taped, but was too late to get a ticket. Now that <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/05/09/310749408/bye-carl-wait-wait-bids-farewell-to-our-official-judge-and-scorekeeper">Carl Kasell</a> is retiring, it&#8217;s unlikely I&#8217;ll ever be at a live show. So it&nbsp;goes…</p>
<h2>Thursday: <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk&nbsp;Show</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> is a better blog than <span class="caps">TTS</span> is a podcast—John Gruber and some of his guests tend to ramble—but you can get good insights on baseball and&nbsp;bourbon.</p>
<h2>Friday: <a href="http://atp.fm"><span class="caps">ATP</span></a></h2>
<p>One word: <a href="http://hypercritical.co">Siracusa</a>. There are two other co-hosts, whose main job is not to screw up too badly. They do it&nbsp;well.</p>
<h2>Saturday: <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/podcast_channel/the-alton-browncast-channel/">The Alton&nbsp;Browncast</a></h2>
<p>The John Siracusa-slash-<a href="http://brettterpstra.com">Bret Terpstra</a> of food. Yes, <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/462617590591156226">Alton Brown is a national treasure</a>.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/04/30/to-cuba-and-back/">To Cuba and&nbsp;back</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>Finishing up our world tour/airplane passenger torture project<sup id="fnref:dora"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dora" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> was a trip from Baltimore to Havana, via Cancun. Before you scream Embargo!, neither my wife nor I are American citizens. Our daughter is, but it is fortunately not illegal for <span class="caps">US</span> citizens to visit Cuba as long as they don&#8217;t spend any money there, at least according to <a href="http://www.travel.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/travel/cuba-doing-it-your-way.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">America&#8217;s most esteemed journal of law, medicine and gastronomy</a>.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason you want to travel to Cuba from the East coast, you might find our experience&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;flight</h2>
<p>We took the United flight from Dulles to Cancun, went through Mexican customs and immigration, then took the Cubana flight to Havana after checking in again. Inbound, layover time was more than 3 hours so we could have comfortably checked a bag or two for those large bottles of sunscreen and other essential liquids. The trip back, however, was tight at 1h 55min, so we decided not to risk waisting time at baggage claim, and only brought&nbsp;carry-ons.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it was half of a good move. On the way back, going through customs, immigration, then walking from Cancun&#8217;s Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 and checking in for the flight to Dulles is barely manageable in those 90-ish minutes after leaving the plane. However, we could—and should—have checked one of the carry-ons on the inbound flight, as sunscreen, diaper cream, and other toiletries are ridiculously expensive in&nbsp;Havana.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NB</span>: You can easily walk from Cancun&#8217;s Terminal 2 Arrivals to Terminal 3 Departures (or 3 -&gt; 2 inbound). There is a shuttle that leaves every 30 minutes and goes Parking -&gt; T1 -&gt; T2 -&gt; T3 -&gt; Parking. The Cancun airport staff told us it would take us 25 minutes to walk from T2 to T3—and that it would take the shuttle at least as much since it makes those other stops—but hey! there&#8217;s this van that magically appeared which would drive us to T3 for the low low price of $20. Google maps said it&#8217;s less than a kilometer between terminals 2 and 3 so we smiled politely and walked away. It took us—three adults with a carry-on and a large shoulder bag each, plus a toddler in tow—less than 10 minutes. Kudos to United for letting us skip the long check-in line and making it to our flight without&nbsp;issues.</p>
<h2>Entry</h2>
<p>Serbian citizens don&#8217;t require a visa, but Dora had only her <span class="caps">US</span> passport. We got her a visa in Cancun at check-in for 20&nbsp;euros.</p>
<p>Cuban entry stamp is bright pink. They asked us before putting one in Dora&#8217;s passport, so I can only assume they occasionally get <span class="caps">US</span> citizens who&#8217;d rather not have their passports stamped for whatever reason (cough, cough). The visa also gets stamped, so there is still proof of&nbsp;entry.</p>
<p>There were no issues going back through Dulles. The customs form asks you which countries you visited on the trip, so we did write we were in Cuba. The immigration officer at Dulles just asked if we were bringing any cigars back with us—of course not, we hadn&#8217;t even smoked any while there!—and finished the fingerprinting in record&nbsp;time.</p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>Bring euros, and bring more than you expect. You can convert <span class="caps">USD</span> to convertible pesos (<span class="caps">CUC</span>) in any exchange office, but with their rates it&#8217;s better to change dollars to euros in your own bank, then change euros to <span class="caps">CUC</span> once in Cuba. Also, convert some <span class="caps">CUC</span> to the <em>peso nacional</em> (<span class="caps">CUP</span>), if only for the ridiculously cheap ice cream you can buy on the&nbsp;street.</p>
<p>As for how much to bring, count on <em>at least</em> $20/person/day, not including the room or the 25 <span class="caps">CUC</span> exit tax. This would cover lunch, dinner, and a daily trip to the beach or a visit to a museum, monument, etc. Since you cannot use American credit/debit cards anywhere on the island, it pays to take more than you think you would&nbsp;need.</p>
<h2>Homestay</h2>
<p>The highlight of the trip! We booked <a href="http://www.homestay.com/cuba/havana/4956-homestay-in-centro-habana-havana">this room</a> on <a href="http://www.homestay.com">homestay.com</a>, and could not be happier with how it turned out. Centro Habana, the neighborhood it&#8217;s in, is definitely not for everyone—very safe, like the rest of Cuba, but also with dog poop and open trash cans everywhere you turn<sup id="fnref:naples"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:naples" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Our <em>casa particular</em> was the opposite—clean, well-maintained, gaudy, but cute. Between our large air-conditioned room, the patio, and the open rooftop terrace, we could easily have spent a couple of days just hanging out there chatting with the friendly&nbsp;hosts.</p>
<h2>Internet</h2>
<p>Don&#8217;t count on being able to get online at any point. We tried checking in online a day before the trip back, but none of the Havana Vieja hotels we tried had any prepaid cards available. Even if they had, there are no printers to print a boarding pass. Unless you&#8217;re staying in a hotel, don&#8217;t even think about wi-fi. Just bring a good book or&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>So, if someone&#8217;s vacations response email tells you they&#8217;re going to Cuba, don&#8217;t count on them having any access, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/morgan-stanleys-parker-on-email-access-2014-4">no matter what some self-important douche bag tells you</a>.</p>
<h2>Guidebooks</h2>
<p>The only resource we used—and we used it multiple times per day—was the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/havana-good-time/id385663683?mt=8&amp;at=1l3v3Zp">Havana Good Time iPhone app</a>. Some of the information on working hours and prices is slightly outdated, but it is all still relevant, and it comes with an offline map of Havana that is—duh—much easier to carry around than the paper&nbsp;version.</p>
<h2>Other DOs and <span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;Ts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do take the Havana tour double decker bus at least&nbsp;once.</li>
<li>Do go to the Revolution Museum—the clunky propagandist English translations alone are worth the 8 <span class="caps">CUC</span> admission&nbsp;fee.</li>
<li>Do try the excellent Coppelito ice&nbsp;cream.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t waste an hour standing in line to pay for it with <span class="caps">CUP</span>—support their economy, and pay for it in hard currency like the tourist you&#8217;re pretending not to&nbsp;be.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t give any <span class="caps">CUC</span> to street performers, especially the kind that chases you down the street with a&nbsp;guitar.</li>
<li>Do throw <span class="caps">CUP</span> at&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t drink the tap&nbsp;water.</li>
</ul>

                <div class="summary"><p>It is always a pain clicking on a link to a journal article only to hit a paywall. It&#8217;s doubly painful when I know I have institutional access via my library&#8217;s proxy server, but have to jump through hoops to get it: go to the library website, log in, copy and paste the article name or <span class="caps">PMID</span> into its PubMed search box, and finally download the <span class="caps">PDF</span>. Arduous, and—turns&nbsp;out—unnecessary.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred 2</a> workflows. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/634331">Here&#8217;s a nice article</a> I found on Twitter today. The <span class="caps">NEJM</span> link in the top right corner leads to an abstract, but I need a special archive subscription for the full <span class="caps">PDF</span>. No matter—I can just highlight the <span class="caps">PMID</span> and hit my special Alfred 2 keyboard&nbsp;combo:</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not already logged into the Welch library proxy, I hit a login wall. It&#8217;s nothing <a href="http://1password.com">1Password</a> can&#8217;t solve, but you can also just type in your username and password yourself, <a href="http://skreened.com/unvisual/like-an-animal">like an animal</a>.</p>
<p>And Bam! The ugly but magic button is where it should be. Your institution might have a prettier&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>To make it clear—this simple workflow will do a PubMed search of <em>any</em> selected text <em>anywhere</em> in <span class="caps">OS</span> X, all through your institutional proxy server. Finding an interesting reference while reading an article, highlighting its title, and hitting ^⎇⌘P to get to the <span class="caps">PDF</span> always feels like&nbsp;magic.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/01/13/why-doctors-shouldnt-use-google-services/">Why doctors shouldn&#8217;t use Google&nbsp;services</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>If you have a Google+ account—and you might not be aware that you do—anyone using Gmail <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/reach-people-you-know-more-easily.html">can now email you</a> without knowing your address. You can disable this &#8220;feature&#8221; in the settings, but having it be opt-out shows yet again how little Google cares about&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that—privacy is a relatively modern invention that younger generations might not care for as much as we do. But you should understand the implications of patients and random strangers being able to leave messages in your personal inbox. Suing P.,,,,,,kmmmmmqmmmdoctors is <a href="http://www.innovateus.net/content/medicine-code-hammurabi"><em>not</em> a modern invention</a>.</p>
<p>This is why I stopped using all Google services—search included—years ago. The company has become so large, with so many users, that it doesn&#8217;t need to cater to fringe interests. And for a business with billions of users, doctors are a fringe group—one that hates <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution">change-for-change&#8217;s-sake</a>, having to [re-learn an interface][ n. Nnjm   interface] &#8220;just because&#8221;, and not being <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/youre-not-googles-custome_b_841599.html">the true customer</a><sup id="fnref:emr"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:emr" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, the number of people at Google who may access my data is huge. <a href="http://www.ownmail.net/?STKI=10207929">FastMail</a><sup id="fnref:referral"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:referral" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, my email provider of choice, has fewer than 10 employees. Gmail alone has hundreds. Not that anyone would be interested in me in particular, but if I ever inadvertently send or receive private patient information through my personal account, I&#8217;d rather as few people as possible see&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Email is fine, but why abandon search? First, I have googled enough ailments and substances, common and obscure, that the add network thought I was an elderly female recovering heroin addict with more than one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia">paraphilia</a>. The adds I would get were in that sense appropriate. Second, because of <span class="caps">SEO</span> the only valuable page-one results I would get were Wikipedia entries. Everything else was a hodgepodge of useless Livestrong, Huffington post and five-pages-per-500-word-article-<span class="caps">AND</span>-behind-a-login-wall Medscape links. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">Duckduckgo</a> and, yes, <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a> at least help with the first problem while not making the second one any&nbsp;worse.</p>
<p>Google calendar is the only service I would consider using. It is fast, reliable, omnipresent and easy to use. There is, however, that constant nagging fear that they will find <em>some</em> way to integrate it with Google+ and yet again sacrifice functionality to force people into its circle<sup id="fnref:heh"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:heh" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This is why I use Apple&#8217;s iCloud calendar, its horrendous web interface and&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Also: Reader. I use <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/">FeedWrangler</a> now, but <em>man</em>.</p>
<p>Doctors&#8217; concerns aside, Google is all set to become the network <span class="caps">TV</span><sup id="fnref:ms"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ms" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> of the internet—large, bland, and largely not relevant to the people who are.

                <div class="summary"><p>Marco Arment <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/01/02/the-triumph-of-new-age-medicine">discovered</a> an old article in The Atlantic pronouncing the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/07/the-triumph-of-new-age-medicine/308554/?single_page=true">triumph of New-Age medicine</a>. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve read it, but the introduction reminded me of what I thought was its biggest fault in&nbsp;reasoning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… But now many doctors admit that alternative medicine often seems to do a better job of making patients well, and at a much lower cost, than mainstream care—and they’re trying to learn from&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternative medicine does not make patients well. It makes them <em>feel</em> well. The difference is&nbsp;huge.</p>
<p>Here are two graphs from an excellent <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1103319#t=article">free-to-access <span class="caps">NEJM</span> article</a> that compared four methods of treating asthma: conventional medicine, placebo, sham acupuncture, and doing nothing<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The first one shows how well the patients in each group <em>felt</em> after 2-4 weeks of&nbsp;treatment.</p>
<p>Ah ha! Conventional medicine was no better than sham (<em>sham!</em>) acupuncture, and both beat placebo inhalers. Alternative medicine wins! Or did conventional medicine lose? At the very least it&#8217;s a&nbsp;draw.</p>
<p>Not so fast. The second graphs shows the amount of objective improvement, measured in <span class="caps">FEV1</span>—the volume of air you exhale during the first second of breathing&nbsp;out:</p>
<p>If this were the common cold, it wouldn&#8217;t have been a big deal. But asthma is not the common cold. People die of it every day, not because they didn&#8217;t feel well—though being unable to breathe is doubtlessly uncomfortable—but because their airways were too tight to get any air out of the&nbsp;lungs.</p>
<p>This is why alternative medicine can be dangerous in the wrong hands, with the wrong patient. Improving quality of life is important, but so is <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2013/ReportNationDec2013Release">curing disease</a>.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>January 1st seemed to be a good day to install Brett Terpstra&#8217;s <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/slogger/">Slogger</a>. Every night, its army of gnomes will go over my tweets, blog posts, completed to-dos, etc. and record them in a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id422304217?mt=12&amp;at=1l3v3Zp">Day One</a> journal entry. Not a replacement for a real journal, true, but better than anything I could do on my&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a Mac-only app that runs from the command line—not user friendly at all. Even so, the installation instructions are straightforward, with some caveats for the not-too-bright, like&nbsp;me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin configuration is done in each individual <em>plugin</em>.rb file, not&nbsp;slogger_config.</li>
<li>All config strings (URLs, file paths, usernames…) should be in quotes (&#8220;…&#8221;), even when in an array (i.e. in square brackets). The Twitter plugin instructions wrongly give an example without&nbsp;quotes.</li>
<li>The Instapaper plugin doesn&#8217;t work since <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds for folders are no longer supported. I&#8217;m still not switching to&nbsp;Pocket.</li>
<li>You will need an <a href="https://ifttt.com/"><span class="caps">IFTTT</span></a> account to log your Facebook posts, using <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/56242">this recipe</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://simplicitybliss.com/integrating-slogger-and-runkeeper/">Instructions for logging RunKeeper activity</a> are convoluted, but&nbsp;work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slogger&#8217;s default time for sucking in your data is 11:50pm, when my laptop is usually in sleep mode. The scheduler should still be smart enough to start the app on wake-up. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s one more reason for me to get a used Mac Mini. In 2015,&nbsp;perhaps.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/29/two-podcasts-three-doctors-one-good-show/">Two podcasts, three doctors, one good&nbsp;show</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>In the last two months, two of my must-listen podcasts, <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic">Systematic</a> and <a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu">Mac Power User</a>, have had medical professionals on as guests. I don&#8217;t usually listen to medical podcasts—Twitter and saved PubMed searches are big enough firehoses—so I thought it would be interesting to hear how my more experienced colleagues use technology. Two of the three episodes were underwhelming, one was&nbsp;stellar.</p>
<p>It started with <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/69">Brett Terprstra and Dr. Pamela Peeke</a> on Systematic. She has several books targeted towards lay public, and the episode went in the same vein—broad advice on nutrition, well-being, etc. I cringed more than once, but that was to be expected—public health information relies on overplaying the risks and simplifying facts to the point of absurdity<sup id="fnref:forecasts"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:forecasts" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The one thing I could agree with was how important meditation can be, as mindful meditation might decrease physician burnout. Negative points for not mentioning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0861719069/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0861719069&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=intern0cd-20">Mindfulness in Plain English</a> as essential reading, though I haven&#8217;t read Dr. Peeke&#8217;s own recommendation, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807012394/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0807012394&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=intern0cd-20">The Miracle of Mindfulness</a>.</p>
<p>I had higher hopes for <a href="http://5by5.tv/mpu/169">Episode 169 of <span class="caps">MPU</span></a>, since Katie Floyd&#8217;s and David Sparks&#8217;s guest, Dr. Jeffrey Taekman, has <a href="http://wippp.com/blog/">an excellent productivity blog</a>. Alas, McSparky spent more than half of the show being fascinated by the minutiae of what doctors do. Which is better than what followed—long periods of uncomfortable silence while the unprepared guest clicked through every app in his menu bar to see if there is anything worth mentioning<sup id="fnref:time"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:time" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. There&nbsp;wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Then another episode of Systematic came on, <a href="http://5by5.tv/systematic/76">with Dr. Don Schaffner, a microbiologist</a><sup id="fnref:phd"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:phd" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It was outstanding. Brett was a better interviewer than David, and avoided getting too side-tracked by his guest&#8217;s interesting work. But ultimately, the show was good because Dr. Schaffner had useful tips and app recommendations that did not simply regurgitate the latest round of <span class="caps">MPU</span>/Mactories/Macdrifter/etc. sponsors. His paper review workflow gave me several ideas I will work on during the holiday downtime. He also suggested <a href="http://www.etymotic.com/ephp/hf3.html">a promising contender</a> in my quest to find headphones that will survive more than 8-12 months of intensive&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>One more thing for me to do during the downtime: promote <a href="http://www.zotero.org">Zotero</a>. Between <a href="http://blog.macademic.org/2013/10/18/papers-3-a-step-in-the-wrong-direction/">the developers fumbling Papers 3</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/19/how-one-publisher-is-stopping-academics-from-sharing-their-research/">Mendeley being taken over by an evil corporation</a>, Zotero coupled with a few extensions is the best reference manager on any platform. Coming in&nbsp;2014.</p>

<li><em>It&#8217;s a light elective</em>—You don&#8217;t need to show&nbsp;up.</li>
<li><em>Needs to read more.</em> (on a written evaluation)—I have no idea how much medicine this person knows. I barely know any&nbsp;myself.</li>
<li><em>The family is reasonable.</em>—Family members don&#8217;t ask too many questions and will agree with anything you&nbsp;say.</li>
<li><em>The patient has xyz</em>.—I&#8217;ve read in an old discharge summary that the patient has <em>xyz</em>, but have no idea how they established the diagnosis, what stage it is in, or what the hell <em>xyz</em> even&nbsp;is.</li>
<li><em>The head is normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation.

<li><em>Thank you for the thorough presentation.</em>—Why did you waste my time with all that useless&nbsp;information?</li>
<li><em>That&#8217;s an outpatient work-up.</em>—Administration is already breathing down my neck because of this patient&#8217;s length of stay and you&#8217;re worried about a mild anemia and a positive&nbsp;hemoccult!?</li>
<li><em>That&#8217;s her new baseline.</em>—Her disease is worse and we don&#8217;t know why, so I guess she&#8217;s stuck with&nbsp;it.</li>

<li>Step two: become a decent <span class="caps">MD</span></li>
<li>Step three:&nbsp;???</li>
<li>Step four:&nbsp;profit!</li>
</ol>
<p>might indeed be a good idea.&nbsp;However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicine implies altruism. Entrepreneurship implies&nbsp;greed.</li>
<li>Programs want their residents to be 100% dedicated to medicine in general and the program in particular. Can you do that with a small business on the&nbsp;side?</li>
<li>Physicians in academia, i.e. those who conduct residency interviews, forgo 300k+ salaries so they could dedicate themselves to research and education. Are you sure telling them about your latest money-making scheme is a good&nbsp;idea?</li>
<li>As a resident, do you look at each patient as an opportunity to help them and learn from them, or to figure out how to build a business around&nbsp;them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Residency programs exist to train physicians, not CEOs. Residency slots are already in short supply. Would program directors give a position to someone who is more likely to end up not practicing medicine at&nbsp;all?</p>

<h2>Medicine</h2>
<h3><span class="caps">MKSAP</span>&nbsp;16</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: all medicine&nbsp;residents</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price: free (if you bought online <span class="caps">MKSAP</span>&nbsp;access)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">MKSAP</span> question bank. No-brainer if you are studying for your internal medicine board or <span class="caps">MOC</span> exam. Less page-flipping and instant gratification. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t allow you to highlighting or annotate the explanations. Also, it can&#8217;t make custom quizzes, can&#8217;t review unanswered/wrong questions, and doesn&#8217;t allow you to copy any of the text to your notes. Lot&#8217;s of cants, but it&#8217;s the only <span class="caps">MKSAP</span> app available. Free if you purchase the electronic version of <span class="caps">MKSAP</span>&nbsp;16.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">ACP</span>&nbsp;Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: all&nbsp;interns</li>
<li>Recommendation: ok, sort&nbsp;of</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems like a good idea, and the content is great, but it is more of a branded <span class="caps">PDF</span> reader than anything else. Doesn&#8217;t have search or favorites, and you have to download each recommendation one by one. The download is fast, but good luck getting what you need without internet access. So, good for night-time reading, particularly if you&#8217;re an intern, but not a good <span class="caps">POC</span>&nbsp;tool.</p>

<p>Whether you&#8217;re a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done"><span class="caps">GTD</span></a> fan or not, this or it&#8217;s more powerful and more expensive sibling <a href="http://macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/">OmniFocus</a> are a must-have for anyone shuffling between more than two areas of responsibility. It still hasn&#8217;t been updated for iOS 7, but is very functional. Only two missing features for me, really: there are no nested tasks/dependencies, and you can&#8217;t filter by more than one&nbsp;tag.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about switching to OmniFocus, but this works well enough for me that the hassle of complete overhauling my system wouldn&#8217;t be worth it. Not to mention the &gt;100$ price&nbsp;tag.</p>

<h3>Boxer</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: everyone who gets more than 5&nbsp;emails/day</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$0.99</li>
</ul>
<p>The best mail client on the iPad. Apple&#8217;s Mail.app was <span class="caps">OK</span> until I realized I spent way too much time scrolling through my list of 20 <span class="caps">IMAP</span> folders whenever I wanted to move an email. Boxer works with Gmail, <span class="caps">IMAP</span> and Exchange accounts, has smart email sorting, and integrates with <a href="http://www.sanebox.com">Sanebox</a>.</p>

<h3>Dropbox</h3>

<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>

<p>If you use Dropbox on your <span class="caps">PC</span>—and you must—then this is a&nbsp;no-brainer.</p>

<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;nerds</li>
<li>Recommendation: <span class="caps">OK</span></li>
<li>Price: $9.99 for&nbsp;either</li>
</ul>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.tonybuzan.com/about/mind-mapping/">Tony Buzan&#8217;s book on mind mapping</a> as a first-year medical student and used the hell out of it for my biophysics, chemistry and genetics coursers. As the material got more complicated, shuffling huge stacks of A3 paper became unwieldy, so I went back to plain old Cornell notes for biochemistry et al. This app is what got me back to making maps, this time when writing review articles and planning out other research. Also good when contemplating the <span class="caps">GTD</span> 50,000 ft&nbsp;view.</p>

<h3>Calendars&nbsp;5</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: all busy&nbsp;overachievers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$6.99</li>
</ul>
<p>The default calendar used to be ugly and impractical. With iOS 7 it&#8217;s just the latter. This is a good replacement. Fantastical for iPad would be nice,&nbsp;though.</p>

<h3>Drafts</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: advanced&nbsp;users</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$3.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Quick note-taking and automation rolled into one. I use it as the default inbox for anything and everything, mainly by appending a dump.txt file in my Dropbox. There is a separate iPhone version that is just as&nbsp;useful.</p>

<h3>Pinner</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;pack-rats</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$1.99</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a> is an excellent almost-free bookmarking and discovery service. There are plenty of iPad clients available, but Pinner seemed to be the most cost-effective. I haven&#8217;t regretted the&nbsp;purchase.</p>

<h3><span class="caps">GW</span>&nbsp;Mail</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: anyone who is forced to use&nbsp;GroupWise</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;meh</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$9.99</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to use GroupWise email for work. This is the only decent client I found for iOS. Stopped looking for a replacement since my last day of residency is less than six months&nbsp;away.</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>
<h3>Reeder&nbsp;2</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: serious feed&nbsp;readers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds since the days of Bloglines (circa 2001) and switched to Google reader after the first big redesign. It&#8217;s sad that Google decided to murder it instead developing its potential as a social service. <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/">Feed wrangler</a> is a good replacement, <a href="http://feedly.com/index.html#welcome">Feedly</a> is a free one. Reeder 2 is the best iPad feed reader there is, and works well with&nbsp;both.</p>

<h3>Instapaper</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: everyone who&nbsp;reads</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$3.99</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read any text that&#8217;s longer than 500 words with any regularity, you need a service that will keep track of the articles and remove all the annoying cruft surrounding the text. <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> is the first one of its kind, and the best way to read articles on it is on an&nbsp;iPad.</p>

<h3>NextDraft</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>Ten good articles hand-picked by an expert hand-picker and delivered (almost) every weekday. My only source of news for the past six&nbsp;months.</p>

<h3>ReadQuick</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;dabblers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>The second book from Tony Buzan that I read was on speed reading. This app will flash words from any article you find online or in your Instapaper/Pocket queue one-by-one at a set rate. Good for those who are too lazy to&nbsp;swipe.</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<h3>Day&nbsp;One</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>A journaling app. I don&#8217;t use it for the Dear-Diary types of texts—though I have no doubt it would be perfect for that. Instead, I use it to keep an archive of meeting and lecture notes (usually started in Drafts and sent to Day One), with an occasional milestone in between. Feature request: multiple&nbsp;journals.</p>

<h3>Byword</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: beginner iPad&nbsp;writers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;ok</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to write a long text on an iPad and don&#8217;t need automation, text expansion et al. then this is the app for&nbsp;you.</p>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: advanced&nbsp;users</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to write a long text on an iPad and like mucking about with workflows, text snippets and Python scripts—which I most certainly do—this is your only choice on any platform. This will become essential next July when I start my long&nbsp;commute.</p>

<h2>Social</h2>
<h3>Twitterific  5 or&nbsp;Tweetbot</h3>
<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Recommendation: meh… you might want to wait for the newest version of Tweetbot to come&nbsp;out</li>
<li>Price: $2.99 for Twitterrific, $2.99 for&nbsp;Tweetbot</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are on Twitter—and if you are a physician <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2010/04/twitter-doctors-guide-health-care-professionals.html">you really should be</a>—please get a decent iOS client. The official one is definitely not it. Tweetbot used to be until iOS 7 came and made it look and feel ancient. Twitterrific is a good—if slightly annoying—substitute, with the added benefit of being universal (i.e. iPhone and iPad with the same purchase). I&#8217;m using the old version of Tweetbot and waiting for the new one, since Twitterific tended to make a mess of my position in the&nbsp;stream.</p>

<h3>Facebook</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: everyone who uses Facebook&nbsp;(why?)</li>
<li>Recommendation: my wife likes&nbsp;it</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, I guess, if you&#8217;re into that sort of&nbsp;thing.</p>

<h3>Skype</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: everyone away from&nbsp;family</li>
<li>Recommendation: <span class="caps">OK</span></li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the international default for long-distance communication, I guess. It gets choppy and drains the battery, but it&#8217;s the only thing my mom knows how to use so I&#8217;m stuck with&nbsp;it.</p>

<h3>Letterpress</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: everyone who can&nbsp;spell</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price: free (with in-app&nbsp;purchase)</li>
</ul>
<p>An excellent turn-based word game. The only multiplayer game I play with any regularity. You need an in-app purchase if you want to play more than two games at the same time, but it&#8217;s well worth it. I have five going on right&nbsp;now.</p>

<ul>
<li>For:&nbsp;nerds</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$1.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Bejeweled meets a 2D <span class="caps">RPG</span>. Hours of fun, even when you get to 100000000000 or however many&nbsp;points.</p>

<h3>Aquaria</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: adventure&nbsp;gamers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$4.99</li>
</ul>
<p>A 2D side-scrolling action-adventure game set under the sea. At my pace I will finish it in about two years, but it&#8217;s great even in 15-minute&nbsp;increments.</p>

<p>Forward an email containing a tracking number to a special email address. <em>Boom</em>, you can now track your package through this app, with push notifications if you&#8217;re into being interrupted whenever a case of -diapers- Wild Turkey is delivered to your front&nbsp;door.</p>

<h3>Eat24</h3>
<ul>
<li>For: serious&nbsp;eaters</li>
<li>Recommendation: <span class="caps">OK</span></li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>

<p>Good app for ordering food in the Baltimore area. Don&#8217;t know about rest of the&nbsp;country.</p>

<ul>
<li>For: world&nbsp;travelers</li>
<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price: free (you pay for the plane ticket,&nbsp;though)</li>
</ul>
<p>The best flight comparison engine there is. Find the most affordable and least annoying plane route. Also does hotel rooms, which I haven&#8217;t&nbsp;tried.</p>

<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>I have used this app exactly once, to watch a couple of episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer while waiting for an Amtrak train. Well worth it,&nbsp;though.</p>

<li>Recommendation:&nbsp;strong</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;free</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t have my original remote any more. We assume Dora ate it. This app is even better, since you don&#8217;t have to muck around with the tiny remote buttons when entering your wifi password or searching&nbsp;Netflix.</p>
