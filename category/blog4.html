                <div class="summary"><p>As first-year fellows, we have to present a case at the Medical Oncology Service tumor board every four weeks. Obviously, I can&#8217;t share the details of those talks here. But I <em>can</em> post a sanitized version of my slides, with all identifying information&nbsp;removed.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/10/10/pain-and-palliation/">Pain. And&nbsp;Palliation.</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>I am not spiritual, or religious. Living in an atheist country that
suddenly takes a turn towards militant Christian fundamentalism does
that to you. I don&#8217;t believe in woo. I do believe that American doctors
are overtreating their patients&#8217; pain, and that American patients are
too sensitized to it. Yes, the understaffed orthopedic <span class="caps">VA</span> surgery wards
where post-op patients were screaming for their morphine may have led
to the Kabuki of a nurse coming in every couple of hours to ask you
about where your pain is, and what is the <span class="caps">QUALITY</span> of the pain, and
howbadisitfromonetoten? But a cancer center is no <span class="caps">VA</span>. The ritual only
reminds those with chronic cancer pain that yes, it is still there,
and yes, it hurts more than it did 3 hours ago, and now they can&#8217;t
finish reading their book because there is a twinge every couple of
minutes while they are thinking about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Which is all a longwinded way of saying that I should not have enjoyed the pain
and pallitavie rotation that much. There is spirituality, there is woo, there is
a lot of pain. And yet I&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>These people know what they are doing. They have plenty of resources
available to do it. And yes, they may &#8220;do Reiki&#8221;—nothing more
than elaborate Kabuki for patients with advanced diseases—but there are
times when that is exactly what the patients need. When 4am vital
signs and checking for hepatomegaly every day just aren&#8217;t&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Some useful questions to ask your patients with any serious chronic
disease, if and when you have some extra time in&nbsp;clinic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you the same person now as you were before the diagnosis? How did you&nbsp;change?</li>
<li>What do you fear the&nbsp;most?</li>
<li>What do you hope&nbsp;for?</li>
<li>Who(m) do you rely on for support?<sup id="fnref:whom"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:whom" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The patients&#8217; answers may surprise&nbsp;you.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Did you hear the one about not prescribing angiotensin receptor blockers to
patients with <span class="caps">ACE</span> inhibitor-induced angioedema? I&#8217;ve had heated debates
with residents in my old clinic who did not want to even consider ARBs for
a patient with worsening diabetic nephropathy who&#8217;s had lip swelling
while on an <span class="caps">ACE</span>-I <em>ten years ago</em>.</p>
<p>Or the one about not giving these patients amlodipine, since there
are two—<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19299323">yes</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330681">two</a>—case reports on amlodipine-associated
angioedema? Should we also stop giving them <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15120149">water</a>?</p>
<p>Then there are shellfish allergies and iodine contrast, fever and
atelectasis, morbid obesity and hypothyroidism… No matter how many
studies show these associations to be too weak to be clinicaly
significant, or just plain false, there will always be an attending
somewhere giving them as his or her pearl of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We need some <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/335/7633/1288">medical mythbusting</a> for physicians, not just the lay&nbsp;public.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://zenhabits.net/weekly-review-key-to-gtd-and-achieving/"><span class="caps">GTD</span> weekly review</a> does a good of job keeping my task list
managable, but not all tasks and projects are equal. It&#8217;s good to have
a sense of when you might have time for deep thinking versus mindless
task processing&#8212;-something <span class="caps">GTD</span> doesn&#8217;t trully account for. I had been doing a
variant of weekly planning since high school, until internship destroyed
any hope of having a <em>daily</em>, let alone weekly plan. It&#8217;s time to start&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>No, he would not. I can write that with confidence of a man who has just burned

why are you punishing me with this drivel? Just get us a good book</em>. So I did,
and the percieved length of my metro commute has decreased by two orders of

                <div class="summary"><p>The average heme/onc fellowship program doesn&#8217;t have many &#8220;tough&#8221;
rotations. The one that is universally feared is the erroneously
named Bone marrow transplant service<sup id="fnref:bmt"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bmt" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. After spending six weeks
on such rotation fresh out of (Chief) residency, I think I can
understand&#8212;-though not agree with&#8212;-the reasons&nbsp;why.</p>
<p>It is not easy. The patients are either already, or about to become,
extraordinarily sick, with little outward signs or symptoms to show
it. Having cancer while not having an immune system is not a good
combination, even if it is temporary. The ones who are months or years
out from a successful transplant and still need to be hospitalized
are usually miserable from longstanding severe graft versus host
disease<sup id="fnref:bias"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bias" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It makes for a tough bunch of humans to deal with&nbsp;day-to-day.</p>
<p>Then again, being on transplant service in an academic center can be the
apex of your inpatient career. Months of residency spent on acute care
floors and in intensive care units should have given you all the skills
you need to do well. These are, in no particular&nbsp;order:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clarifying ambiguity</em>: The rounds are over, attendings and consultants have
  dispersed, and you have just heard more facts about T-cell activation than you
  realized existed. But&#8212;-do you know if that febrile-but-not-neutropenic patient
  should get an antibiotic? What&#8217;s that other patient&#8217;s target Tacro
  level? Send <span class="caps">CSF</span> for flow, or just give intrathecal Methotrexate? If those
  aren&#8217;t clear, you should have asked more questions, and not of the &#8220;Which cells
  have <span class="caps">IL</span>-6 receptors?&#8221;&nbsp;kind.</li>
<li><em>Identify attending priority</em>: This is often the biggest cause of ambiguity.
  Between the floor attending, the study <span class="caps">PI</span>, staff <span class="caps">ID</span> consultant, and various other
  consulting services, whose advice do you heed? Not always the same person&#8217;s,
  and not even in the same order. Not much you can do, except be aware of it,
  and not follow everyone&#8217;s advice as soon as you hear&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><em>Asserting your autonomy</em>: With all this asking and following, you may rightly ask
  if you were anything more than a glorified intern. In the field of
  hematology, oncology, and infections that affect this population, you most
  certainly are&#8212;-you are, after all, still in training. Not so for most other
  matters of internal medicine. Blood pressures, fingerstick, <span class="caps">TSH</span> levels&#8212;-if
  you are comfortable managing them, let the team&nbsp;know.</li>
<li><em>Being there early</em>: An important trait often forgotten by senior <span class="caps">IM</span> residents.
  Just getting there an hour earlier than anyone else to get the work done makes
  you look like a superstar. One hour in the early morning save three in the late&nbsp;afternoon.</li>
<li><em>Dictating right away</em>: Like, pronto. The answer to &#8220;How many pending
  dictations do you have&#8221; should always be &#8220;Zero&#8221;. It&#8217;s easier for you, and is
  just good patient care. No&nbsp;excuses.</li>
<li><em>Writing everything down</em>: This is How to be an intern 101, but being at least two
  years removed from internship can make you stupid. Carry the patient list and
  <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Push-Clip-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.4-mm-Black/pd/797">a good pen</a> with you at all times. Yes, that includes the&nbsp;restroom.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing here is particular to transplants&#8212;-it is just good inpatient
medicine. Which may be why so many oncology fellows loathe it&#8212;-it is,
after all, an outpatient specialty. Then again, stem cell transplants
are one of the few therapies we have that can cure&nbsp;cancer.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>This has become the mantra of every medical student, intern, and
resident wanting to appear smart on rounds and conferences, of every
attending intent on shooting down a team member&#8217;s suggestion. Five,
ten years ago it might have have signaled genuine interest. Now
it means, usually, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about the subject, but I&#8217;m
still calling you out on (what I think is) your <span class="caps">BS</span>. Here, look at me! I am&nbsp;evidence-based!&#8221;</p>
<p>No, nobody has posed me that question in quite a while, and I don&#8217;t
remember ever asking it in any context<sup id="fnref:questions"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:questions" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. But, honestly,
except for a few <a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/7842">very well-known examples listed in this excellent
post</a>, you can find &#8220;evidence&#8221; in the medical
literature to back up any claim. Off-the-cuff conversations during

                <div class="summary"><p>Of the three pillars of medicine, research is the most ellusive. Unless you are
in an <span class="caps">MD</span>/PhD program&#8212;-not an option for most Europeans&#8212;-you will have other
priorities in medical school. And unless your residency program has a built-in
research year, the way most surgical residencies do, you will either be way too
busy in a university or a large community program to do any research, or have
plenty of free time in a lower volume community hospital that doesn&#8217;t have many
research&nbsp;opportunities.</p>
<p>When I interviewed residents-to-be last year, my first thought on seeing
a non-PhD applicant having 18 publications on his or her <span class="caps">CV</span> wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Wow,
she is a research <em>machine</em>, we gotta have her&#8221;, but rather doubt that anyone
could be that productive during medical school. More points subtracted for
thinking the interviewers would be so&nbsp;gullible.</p>
<p>I graduated six years ago, far enough not to be able to give advice
on how to do research as a medical student. The hows and whys are
institution-specific, so anything I wrote would have to be in Serbian
anyway. Residencies, though, are similar enough to each other that I do
have some words of advice for new residents wanting to do Research! in a
community hospital, university-affiliated or&nbsp;not.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Patient care trumps research.</em> Unless you have already worked as an attending
  in another country before coming to the <span class="caps">US</span> for residency, don&#8217;t waltz in to
  your PDs office on day one asking about research opportunities. Prove yourself on
  the field first, then six months later, when you&#8217;re comfortable managing <span class="caps">DVT</span>
  prophylaxis, septic shock, and what not, start asking&nbsp;questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Get your own idea?</em> Common wisdom says it is better to come up
with your own question and start your own projects, since you will
be more invested in the outcome. Well, yes, sort of. Unless it is a
quick-and-dirty chart review you can do over a two-week vacation&#8212;-and
even then there are <span class="caps">IRB</span> hoops you&#8217;d need to jump through to get anything
done&#8212;-you will get your inexperienced self into the murky world of
project management. Many brilliant ideas have died on the field of
required signatures, ambiguous data points, and impossible-to-coordinate
meetings. Which is why this next advice is&nbsp;important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Find good mentors.</em> Surrounding yourself with a few good people is orders of
  magnitude better than having many good ideas. Research topics come and go, as
  does our interest in different fields of medicine (yesterday&#8217;s apoptosis is
  today&#8217;s epigenetics is tomorrow&#8217;s something or other). It
  is unlikely that the research your started in residency will continue onward
  into fellowship, but the knowledge, skills, and general wisdom you pick up from
  your mentors should serve you well into your career. <span class="caps">NB</span>: don&#8217;t wait for someone
  to be &#8220;assigned&#8221; to you&#8212;-although that&#8217;s what many residency programs will
  do. Seek out people who match your character and who would be able to give you
  advice in at least three fields: patient care, research methodology, and
  research topics. This can be one person, or five. And if you find an awesome
  mentor who just isn&#8217;t doing any research right then, you can always write
  a&nbsp;review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Is it Science! or quality improvement?</em> <span class="caps">ACGME</span> is big on Quality! and
  Patient Safety! this year. Programs take notice. If you can present your
  interest as a quality improvement
  project rather than small-s-science, consider doing it. Not only
  does showing interest in quality improvement look good on a <span class="caps">CV</span>,
  your institution might have special funds for resident <span class="caps">QI</span> projects.
  A dedicated <span class="caps">QI</span> mentor is also a good resource, if you want a carreer as a Sith
  lor&#8212;-erm, hospital&nbsp;administrator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interest in research goes from <em>I just want something on my <span class="caps">CV</span> so I
could get a fellowship</em> to <em>When I grow up, I&#8217;ll have my own lab</em>, but
this applies to most people in most&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
