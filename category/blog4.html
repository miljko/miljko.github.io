My latest, on breast cancer in men, seemed to be well-received. I suspect it was because, unlike most rare cancers, this one was easy to fit into a preexisting pattern: it is just like female breast cancer, except for… And voilà—you get quick and easily understood knowledge about a whole new disease&nbsp;entity.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>First they came for the <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/06/08/editorial-1-1-1-rejected-from-the-app-store/">nerds</a>.</p>
<p>Now they are <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id806809930?at=1l3v3Zp">coming for the doctors</a> (see What&#8217;s New in Version 3.0.5).
The makers of MedCalc, the best medical calculator app out there, <a href="http://medcalc.medserver.be/dosegate.html">explained
what happend</a> in detail<sup id="fnref:dosegate"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dosegate" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This was the rule they were
supposedly&nbsp;infringing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>22.9</strong> Apps that calculate medicinal dosages must be submitted by the
manufacturer of those medications or recognized institutions such as
hospitals, insurance companies, and&nbsp;universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevermind that many doctors view themselves as institutions—this is
an idiotic rule. Is University of Baltimore, which has no biomedical
science courses or programs, allowed to publish a drug dose calculator?
Is <span class="caps">GEICO</span>?</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FDA</span> has issued <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM263366.pdf">guidance for mobile medical apps</a>. It
specificaly allows calculators that use generally available formulas,
and forbids apps which calculate <em>radiation</em> dosage, but does not
mention drugs. Where, then, did this rule come&nbsp;from?</p>
<p>It is, of course, the same App store rules that allowed <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homeopathy-cures/id479869465?mt=8">these</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homeopathy-materia-medica/id623045549?mt=8">pearls</a>

                <div class="summary"><p>If the unstated goal of these rotation post-mortems was to summarize
what I had learned, a single post may not be enough for breast
cancer. Six weeks ago, I knew that it was <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/probability-breast-cancer">common</a>, maybe
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening/breast/HealthProfessional/page8#_423_toc">overdiagnosed</a>, possibly <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.28260/full">overtreated</a>,
and <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-funding">beating all other cancers for research funding by a vast
margin</a>. All this was a vague sense of being informed—like a
<span class="caps">NYT</span> reader may feel after reading the Sunday Magazine feature—rather than
actual&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
<p>Having talked to a good number of women with breast cancer, and
worked with a few attendings dedicated to the field, I know it
enough to know that I need to know more; but also enough to
keep me interested. What from the outside looks like cookbook
<em>this-marker-means-she&#8217;s-getting-that-treatment</em> medicine is in fact an
intricate work of knowing your patient, figuring out where she stands in
the heaps of data generated by decades-long studies following thousands
of women on different protocols, discussing the options, and coming to a
mutualy agreed decision<sup id="fnref:preposterous"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:preposterous" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Hard work, all of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Harder still is working on those data-generating trials. Anyone can
think of a clinicaly relevant question, but can they make it into a
feasable protocol? Can they gather a team to manage all the patients in
the center, and all the different centers? Can they manage that team?
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-funding">Looking at a recent set of trials you will hear more about soon</a>,
the scale boggles the&nbsp;mind.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/in-the-ivory-tower/">In the ivory&nbsp;tower</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>The rotation is called malignant hematology, but between Thanksgiving,
Christmas, New Year&#8217;s, and everyone being away for <span class="caps">ASH</span>, it was a joke.
The only memorable part were the first two weeks—the oncology consults
at Georgetown—which reminded me that the <span class="caps">NIH</span> was indeed an ivory
tower. This is compared to a well-known academic center. Compared to
a community hospital—<a href="http://www.lifebridgehealth.org/Sinai/Sinai1.aspx?cpsys_redirect=404">my last employer being a good example</a>,
though you may find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Stroger,_Jr._Hospital_of_Cook_County">much better</a>—the Institutes in general and
the Clinical Center in particular are a tower of crystalized angel
tears sitting high on top of a mountain range on Mars. This is neither
criticism nor praise, but a statement of fact<sup id="fnref:tears"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tears" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having only spent four days on Georgetown consult service, I would
rather not comment<sup id="fnref:bad"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bad" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. But here are ten things about the inpatient
side of my home institution that might interest the outside&nbsp;world:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is only one <span class="caps">EMR</span> and no paper&nbsp;charts;</li>
<li>Someone else, most commonly the research nurse, will obtain the outside
  records and have them scanned in—so the <span class="caps">EMR</span> is the only place you need to look
  for&nbsp;anything;</li>
<li>There are usually no medical students, interns, or residents—it&#8217;s the <span class="caps">NP</span>/<span class="caps">PA</span>,
  fellow, and the attending running the&nbsp;show;</li>
<li>Remember the 3am page from the nurse asking for a Tylenol order? If it is for
  someone on a phase 1 trial, you&#8217;d better check the protocol and call the
  attending before giving&nbsp;it;</li>
<li>Patients can be &#8220;out on pass&#8221;—meaning they can leave the campus for up to
  20-something days and still count as an inpatient, without needing to be
  discharged and&nbsp;readmitted;</li>
<li>If a patient needs to stay an extra day or two because of transport issues, 
  nobody blinks an&nbsp;eye;</li>
<li>For three to to five days you will get weird looks if it is your patient, but
  there will be no passive-aggresive emails about the hospital not getting&nbsp;reimbursement;</li>
<li>If it is six days or more it is likely they are homeless—social work will be on&nbsp;it;</li>
<li>Ordering most imaging—ultrasounds, CTs, MRIs, etc—requires two steps: getting
  a time-slot from central scheduling, or the tech on call if it is a same-day
  scan, and putting in the order. Think about the implications and let it sink&nbsp;in;</li>
<li>All discharge medications are dispensed from the outpatient pharmacy free of
  charge to the patient. Yes, all of&nbsp;them;</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people treated at the Clinical Center are trial participants who
are sick, rather than &#8220;just&#8221; patients. There are no administrative or financial
pressures, no dealings with insurance companies, and not much concern with
disposition. As you can imagine, this makes for a beautiful work&nbsp;environment.</p>

<p><strong>What is an online resource for learning statistics needed for clinicians
explained in a language that could be understood by&nbsp;doctors?</strong></p>
<p>There are many biostatistics courses available on
<a href="http://coursera.org">Coursera</a>. Living in Baltimore,
I&#8217;m biased towards <span class="caps">JHU</span>&#8217;s offerings. <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/casebasedbiostat">&#8220;Case-Based Introduction to
Biostatistics&#8221;</a> by Dr. Scott
Zeger is a good one. If you prefer text to video, here are three
good&nbsp;resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>An article: <a href="http://images.cell.com/images/EdImages/etbr/DUKES.PDF">&#8220;A Review of Basic
Biostatistics&#8221;</a>
by Kimberly Dukes and Lisa Sullivan (free <span class="caps">PDF</span>)</li>
<li>A short book: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/science-art-medicine/id643948555?mt=11">&#8220;The Science of the Art of
Medicine&#8221;</a> by Dr. John Brush (free, iBooks&nbsp;only)</li>
<li>A textbook: <a href="http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/statistical-inference-for-everyone-sie.html">&#8220;Statistical Inference for
Everyone&#8221;</a> by Brian Blais (also&nbsp;free)</li>
</ul>
<p>If I had to pick one, it would be Dr. Brush&#8217;s book. He is a cardiologist
writing for other physicians in a language they can understand. Also,
<a href="http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/category/richard-lehmans-weekly-review-of-medical-journals/">Dr.
Lehman</a> recommended it, which is more than good enough for&nbsp;me.</p>
