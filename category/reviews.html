                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/11/12/ending-medical-reversal/">Ending medical&nbsp;reversal</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>The first thing I picked up after taking the hematology boards was this gem from Chicago&#8217;s medical royalty ([Adam Cifu](https://twitter.com/adamcifu)) and everyone&#8217;s favorite oncologist (this is of course a joke — you know that people hate your guts,&nbsp;[Vinay](https://VPplenarysesh)).</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t, and still don&#8217;t, care much for the title. It is ambiguous: if medical reversal means overturning an established practice that was based on weak to no evidence once stronger evidence comes along — usually in the form of a (multi-center, blinded) randomized controlled trial — why on earth would you want to end reversals? Well, the book is about how to stop those kinds of practices from becoming established in the first place, which would indeed end medical reversal, but an easier way to stop them and one that would be endorsed by most of industry and many researches would be to just not look. &#8220;Ending Medical Reversal the Hard Way&#8221; is therefore a more appropriate&nbsp;name.</p>

<p>Title aside, I agreed with pretty much everything they wrote, from reforming medical education, through stopping direct-to-consumer marketing and direct-to-academic (not their words) payments, to having more people participate in (simpler, cheaper, and fairer) randomized trials. I enjoyed their honesty and clear style, and wished my medical school had at least a passing resemblance to the one they proposed (if you thought <span class="caps">US</span> medical education leaned too much on basic science-oriented and was heavy in professorial mechanistic proclamations, try the average European med school). Granted, I work in a federal research hospital and focus on some of the rarest of the rare diseases; but that only makes me shake my head in disbelief more when my colleagues who specialize in breast or lung cancer, not to mention coronary artery disease and diabetes, randomize enormous numbers of patients to search for minute differences in surrogate&nbsp;outcomes.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2018/10/20/stubborn-attachments/">Stubborn&nbsp;Attachments</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>This is as close to a &#8220;Rules for Life&#8221; book as we&#8217;ll get from Tyler Cowen, and if you&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.conversationswithtyler.org">listened to his podcast</a> or <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com">followed his blog</a> what&#8217;s inside won&#8217;t surprise you — but it will make you think. Which is good: surprise is overrated anyway, and things that depend on it don&#8217;t do well on re-reading/watching/listening. I&#8217;ll be coming back to this&nbsp;one.</p>

<p>Cowen argues that growth is good even when it doesn&#8217;t benefit everyone all the time. There are things that can grow that you can&#8217;t measure (like happiness, life satisfaction, health, culture, feeling of superiority [I may be misremembering some of these]), so don&#8217;t focus on wealth only but instead on Wealth Plus. Also, distant future is just as important as the near future, so don&#8217;t sacrifice long-term prospects for short-term gains. Speaking of future, we can&#8217;t predict it, so even though tiny decisions can influence it in an oversized manner we should stop fretting over those and focus on the big picture: which is to chose policies that provide the greater sustained benefit sooner. Finally, common sense morality can usually steer you in the right direction, but if it feels like it&#8217;s not, remember everything else in the book and you should be all&nbsp;set.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, except that I kept imagining someone from Serbia — currently a second-world European kakistocracy — living by the standards of this book. Hilarity ensued: for things would be included in Wealth Plus that Cowen hadn&#8217;t foreseen (the ability to redraw borders, to name one), and common sense morality would include good doses of nepotism, chauvinism, and the desire to cheat the state (yes, yes, I know,&nbsp;#notallserbs).</p>

<p>So the first thing that&#8217;s keeping this book from being great is that it can&#8217;t be universally applied — it was written by an American for his fellow Americans who have lost their way — and doesn&#8217;t explore, or even mention, the implications of his vague concepts of Wealth Plus and common sense morality being different around the&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>The second is that shortly after admitting that economists don&#8217;t have crystal balls (the twelve-year-old me would have loved to put parentheses around &#8220;crystal&#8221;), he goes on to compare hypothetical policies based on their projected rates of growth well into the future. It may be my lack of an economic background speaking, but how can those two go&nbsp;together?</p>

<p>But do read the book. After my first pass I can say it&#8217;s good, if not great. For me as a doctor the idea of delaying gratification for long-term gains felt familiar. The oncologist in me would add that inflicting harm for a known long-term benefit is also reasonable and depending on the alternatives even preferred. Of course, it took centuries of wading in the dark before medicine got to the point where it could with any certainty predict the outcome of its interventions. Are social sciences there&nbsp;yet?</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Jane Jacobs loved Greenwich Village so much that she wrote a book about why that was and why more neighborhoods weren’t like it. She looked at other similar areas in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, etc. as well some failed ones, and gave a few guidelines on what was needed for safe, lively, and desirable city&nbsp;streets.</p>

<p>It has enough whimsical observations of city life to keep things interesting for its too-many—over 400—pages (e.g. on a city park’s homeless population: <i>Almost imperceptibly, like the hand of a clock, the raggle-taggle reception creeps around the circular pool at the center of the square. And indeed, it is the hand of a clock, for it is following the sun, staying in the warmth. </i>Or, comparing a safe-but-dirty city street to a desired but decidedly unsafe park: <i>The sidewalks were dirty, they were too narrow for the demands put upon them, and they needed shade from the sun. But here was no scene of arson, mayhem or the flourishing of dangerous weapons. In the playground where the night-time murder had occurred, things were apparently back to normal too. Three small boys were setting fire under a wooden bench. Another was having his head beaten against the concrete. The custodian was absorbed in solemnly and slowly hauling down the American flag</i>). It’s all quite&nbsp;lovely.</p>

<p>But ultimately, it is an exercise in confirmation bias that misses as many essential points as it reveals. What was arguably the most devastating influence on American cities — Robert Moses — is but a misguided elderly official who, and kudos to him, knows his way around public funds. City planners like big, disruptive projects because of their bad (deductive!) reasoning, not because they give politicians photogenic ribbon-cutting&nbsp;ceremonies.</p>

<p>If you want to know why American cities are the way they are, better read <i>The Power Broker</i>.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Extraordinary set pieces strung together by the thinnest of plots, based on an absurd, sitcom-worthy failure to communicate. A particular subplot should have been spun off as a buddy cop&nbsp;movie.</p>

<p>The Ray-Luke-Kylo triangle should have been a bigger part of the movie, but then many of the new characters, the ones that aren’t white and/or men, would have nothing to do. Such are the problems of building on an old and popular franchise: you can’t both stay true to the roots and change with the&nbsp;times.</p>

<p>It has cute animals and looks good in 3D though, so Dora (5.4)&nbsp;approves.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>What you do is you take as many fairy-tales and myths and other stories as you can — Campbell is extraordinarily good at collecting them — then squint and trace out the patterns. Us humans are very good at finding patterns where none exist (<a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a17529/a-short-history-of-martian-canals-and-mars-fever/">just ask Percival Lowell</a>), so it is no wonder that we end up with an overarching story, albeit disjointed, which is — of course it is — steeped in New Age <a href="https://meaningness.com/monism">monism</a>.</p>

<p>Plot twist: unlike <a href="http://digitalesammlungen.uni-weimar.de/viewer/image/PPN64011217X/1/#topDocAnchor">similar attempts in other arts</a>, this one becomes wildly successful, serving as a template for other stories that end up following it more closely than any of the tales of old ever did (see <a href="http://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers">Kevin Garvey’s literal and metaphorical travails</a> for the most recent example). I like The Leftovers, so I would say The Hero… is a net benefit for the civilization. It just wasn’t for&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I stopped reading the book near the end of the first (of two) sections, the one about The Hero’s Journey. I therefore never got to the Cosmogonic cycle, and cannot comment. Do let me know if there was a surprise&nbsp;ending.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>An oncologist(?), a psychologist, and a surgeon give master classes on unprofessional behavior while treating <span class="caps">JGL</span> and his <a href="http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/19/2/193.full">unfortunately named tumor</a>. Even though only one of the three was meant to look bad in the movie, they each break a fundamental rule of the doctor-patient relationship: don’t be a douchebag, don’t sleep with the patient, don’t tell them everything will be fine when you have no clue. Cut out the profanities, and you’d have a semester’s worth of medical ethics&nbsp;discussions.</p>

<p>Cut out the profanities, though, and you’ll miss half the movie. Seth Rogen — a dirty old man trapped inside Fozzy the Bear — does what he’s been doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5iaHTkpTv0">ever since Judd Apatow found him</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/FNskZ6GQz2A">heart of gold included</a>. Fortunately, 50/50 has better timing than anything to come out from the Apatow cringe factory, and even has a&nbsp;point.</p>

<p>Medical miscellanea: was the diagnosing physician a medical oncologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, or an orthopedic surgeon? Likely not the first, else he wouldn’t give neoadjuvant cytarabine for a sarcoma, and probably not the latter two since another, overoptimistic <span class="caps">MD</span> does the actual surgery. Can a psychologist perform interviews for what she admits will be her PhD thesis without getting informed consent? How can a surgeon say with any certainty that “everything will be fine” minutes after performing what she admitted to be a difficult operation <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301698002235">for a tumor with a relapse rate north of 50%</a>. You know, the 50% that gave the movie its&nbsp;name.</p>

<p>Still, thumbs&nbsp;up.</p>

Trying to be deliberately inoffensive to a particular class of <i>consumer</i>, it dodges <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v2exWrsGOc">Mickeydom’s most glorious moments of cultural sensitivity</a> only to fall on the sword of blandness. But credit where it is due — it takes talent to make a trippy 60s comic book that’s oddly relevant in <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/03/14/maintaining-sanity-weird-timeline/">today’s world of magic mystery turmoil</a> into a boring, predictable, dull, uninspired, yawn-inducing, delta wave-producing, paint-by-numbers origin&nbsp;story.</p>

<p>And if you thought only the Strange-ness was fumbled you must not be a doctor, because <a href="https://youtu.be/bUi8Youavz8">his day job features the most laughable medicine this side of the Human Centipede</a>.

                <div class="summary"><p>Every ballet metaphor told and/or written by dancers, visualized: you don’t feel like a swan, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCmY7Q8wwts">you become one</a>; competitiveness means <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jeq15Jw88M">murdering the competition</a>; and liberating yourself from constraints is <a href="https://youtu.be/zNPUsQYlSB0?t=1m48s">suicide</a>. It is on the nose and at times painful to watch, but I would not expect anything else <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADJE5gat_W8">from the master of the afterschool special</a>.</p>

<p>Portman is a pro: she gets you to swallow the banal white swan/black swan analogy whole, and ask for more, goes through every exercise in Aronofsky’s mental torture playbook like it’s nothing, and looks believably cool and composed until she believably isn’t. Watching her in this movie makes a certain trilogy an even bigger crime against&nbsp;directing.</p>
