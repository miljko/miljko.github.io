<p>Very few children. Assuming all the little Audreys and Maddisons are attending their ballet lessons, or&nbsp;whatnot.</p>
<p>Restaurants with street seating. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m back in Belgrade. Alas, most of them serve nothing but greasy American classics, only they call it Southern-style and put even more&nbsp;grease.</p>
<p>Are people who eat at these places the same ones doing all the&nbsp;running?</p>
<p>Why do two different streets in the same neighborhood have the exact same name? If you put a super-block that cuts a road in half, does it not make sense to rename one of&nbsp;them?</p>

<p>When I was a house officer and installing one of the first right-heart
catheters, the machine that showed intrapulmonic arterial pressures was
enormous and was equipped with strain gauges rather than computer chips.
Making it work was difficult. After the line was in, the attending, the
nurse, and I tried desperately to adjust the machine to show the pulmonary
arterial pressure waves. We could not get them. The line on the screen
remained flat. We manipulated toggle switches and strain gauges for about 15
minutes. Nothing. Finally, I glanced at the patient: He was&nbsp;dead.</p>

<p>Who will be crushed to lose me as a listener, I am&nbsp;sure.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t suddenly decided that they are all <em>bad</em>, mind you—I have
spent cumulative <em>months</em> listening to them, so they <em>must</em> be good. The
problem is, I like them too&nbsp;much.</p>

<p>Granted, being mostly free, not too hard on your body, sometimes
educational, and often entertaining, podcasts are not the
worst thing in the world to be addicted to. But to be alone

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2016/02/08/storytellers/">Storytellers</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>Last week I shared a brief reflection on a tiny aspect of my commute.
<a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2016/02/04/the-707-train/" title="Infinite regress • The 7:07 train dilemma">Please check it out it if you haven&#8217;t already</a>, it is a quick&nbsp;read.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t that nice? It started by introducing some old concepts in a
new light—you knew about trains before, and maybe even knew there was
a <span class="caps">MARC</span> Penn that line goes from Baltimore to <span class="caps">DC</span>, but probably didn&#8217;t
know the specific trains and their timetables. Then it gave you a
coherent explanation of a phenomenon you hadn&#8217;t known about before. This
first caused slight, but not unpleasant, cognitive strain while you
were figuring out what I writing about, followed by the small pleasure
of an ah-hah moment once the pieces&nbsp;clicked.</p>
<p>It was a brain massage, if you will. It was also complete&nbsp;bull.</p>
<p>Not that anything I wrote was wrong, as far as I know, but I didn&#8217;t
give many arguments for it being right, either. There were no ridership
statistics or arrival times to back up my claims. And even if there
were—I didn&#8217;t give any alternative hypotheses to explain the situation,
nor reasons why those would be less likely than my own explanation. When
you think about it, it was more of a brain Twinkie than a massage—all
empty calories, with a fleeting feeling of&nbsp;fullness.</p>
<p>Welcome to 99.99999% of the written word, and to anything ever spoken
out&nbsp;loud.</p>
<p>We like stories. They need to make a threshold amount of sense (this is
why societies universally ostracize schizophrenics). They should contain
an element of surprise (it is not that the 7:07 train would come <em>later</em>
than the 7:23—twists like that do not surprise anyone any more—it is
that it comes in <em>much</em> earlier because people think it wouldn&#8217;t). And
they get bonus points if—as my last parenthetical implied—they paint
<em>the others</em> as stupid or incompetent. There are many more checkboxes;
more of them checked, the better the&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>Most professions are based on storytelling. Doctors tell different
stories to their patients, each other, and themselves—as do most other
scientists, to a different degree. Lawyers tell stories to their clients
to make them believe they will craft good ones for the judge, jury, and
the opposing side. Ask a marketer what makes a good commercial (spoiler:&nbsp;story).</p>
<p>Being a coal miner doesn&#8217;t involve telling stories. No one wants to be a
coal&nbsp;miner.</p>
<p>Our minds prefer a good story over a true one, and will have us believe
it more, too. However, the more boxes you see checked, the more
suspicious you should be that someone manipulated the tale to make it
more pleasurable, ergo memorable, ergo&nbsp;believable.</p>
<p>(So, if what you&#8217;ve just read made&nbsp;sense…)</p>
<p>If you are looking for an objective truth—or getting as close to it
as possible—any medium that involves audio/visual queues will be an
impediment. Sights and sounds stir up emotions, and emotions prime us to
believe or not to believe. Pay attention to the background music in a
documentary, or how the desk of that shifty lawyer they&#8217;re interviewing
is a complete&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TV</span> news is, of course, a joke—this is why comedy shows are becoming the
most popular delivery&nbsp;form.</p>
<p>Written word has its own way of deceiving—anecdotes, incomplete data,
misquotes, <a href="http://m.sss.sagepub.com/content/44/4/638.full">lazy references</a>—all to make a better narrative. Just read
anything by Malcolm Gladwell. And look at the time it takes to get
to the bottom of just one tiny factoid in that story of the iron
content in spinach. Finding truth is exhausting and exasperating, and people whose
job it is to find it (hello, accountants) are way less fun than those
who make stuff up. Mark Twain said it&nbsp;best:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its&nbsp;shoes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Misquoted? <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cindy-lovell/thats-what-he-said-quotin_b_4282800.html">Most likely.</a> Or is Huff Post wrong? It wouldn&#8217;t be the first&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>There is nothing in this post that bigger and better minds than my own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Acognitive%20bias">haven&#8217;t
written about already</a>. But
that&#8217;s a boatload of pages! Not many people have the time, discipline,
<em>and</em> interest to read all that—and even if they did, they would keep
making the same mistakes over again, as shown in several studies
described in those same books (yes, yes, all studies are flawed; one
windmill at a time, please). These things are hard-wired, and for a good
reason—evolution doesn&#8217;t care for objective&nbsp;truths.</p>
<p>Or maybe it does. I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve just made it&nbsp;up.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Here is a screen grab of the the <a href="http://mta.maryland.gov/schedules/display.php?route=penn_southbound.xls" title="Marc Penn Southbound">Marc Penn line southbound schedule</a>.</p>
<p>![Marc Penn Southbound](/images/marc-southbound.png&nbsp;=800x139)</p>
<p>Note train 415, departing Baltimore Penn at 7:00 (I get on at West
Baltimore, so in my mind it&#8217;s the 7:07 train). Also note train 517—my
7:23, and the times they both arrive at Washington Union&nbsp;Station.</p>
<p>Is it ever worth taking the&nbsp;7:07?</p>
<p>Well, actually, yes.&nbsp;Because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most commuters look at the schedule and make the same conclusion that you probably did: waking up at least 16 minutes earlier in the morning is not worth the 7 minute lead time you get in <span class="caps">DC</span>.</li>
<li>With that in mind, even if they leave early they don&#8217;t really rush to the 7:07; therefore significantly fewer people need to get in at each stop compared to the 7:23 and it usually gets to Union slightly ahead of&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>Because of more people waiting on the 7:23 it tends to limp along in the last few stops and doesn&#8217;t get to Union until 8:15 in the best of&nbsp;days.</li>
<li>The 15-20 minute difference does mean a lot if you have to use <span class="caps">DC</span>&#8217;s abysmal metro which gets crowded by the minute between 8 and&nbsp;9.</li>
</ul>

<li>a place to repost comments, reviews, and recommendations I wrote on other sites (like Quora, Amazon,&nbsp;etc);</li>
<li>a place where my half-baked ideas and philosophizings go if I think them interesting enough for general&nbsp;consumption.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last one is what gives me trouble. Ideally, if I think a
topic is worth writing about, I should make the extra 3-day
effort to gather references, edit it nicely, and have it
published. But like the character in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_on_the_Drina">&#8220;The bridge on the
Drina&#8221;</a> who
<em>means</em> to be the town chronicler but can never find an event worthy
enough to write about, most subjects have me less excited the more I
think about them. By the time I finish a blog post, then, I have no
intention to revisit the&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p>This is an excellent filter against appearing foolish in print, but horrible for&nbsp;productivity.</p>
<p>Two solutions come to mind readily, with equal chances of failing—either stop posting the third category of articles altogether and start writing everything with an intention of publishing; or start writing even more with the hope that at least a small percentage of that will turn into something a journal would accept for&nbsp;publication.</p>
<p>The former is a set-up for procrastination, the latter—doing extra work in a hope to create material for even more work—oxymoronic . I will try both and see where I end&nbsp;up.</p>
