                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2015/05/29/the-overhead/">The&nbsp;overhead</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>There are many misnomers in American medical English. Patients walk into
your <em>clinic</em> (from Greek <em>kline</em>, bed) to learn whether their scan was
<em>negative</em> (good) or <em>positive</em> (bad). Those who have severe chronic
pain may ask for their <em>pain medicine</em> (that relieve pain, not cause
it), usually opioids. Some physicians would call them <em>pain-seeking</em>
(though what they are seeking is relief). If they don&#8217;t get a prescription,
they may rate their doctor poorly on a patient satisfaction survey,
which is a big thing if you are into <em>quality improvement</em>. <em>Quality</em>
improvement. There&#8217;s a&nbsp;misnomer.</p>
<p><em>Quality improvement</em> in medicine is <a href="http://www.hrsa.gov/quality/toolbox/methodology/qualityimprovement/index.html">by definition</a>
limited to improving things you can measure, i.e. quantify, i.e. judge
by criteria that are the <em>ying</em> to quality&#8217;s <em>yang</em>. Those measures may
be valid or not, and may improve patients&#8217; lives, longevity, etc. (or
not) but they are not quality. Because they are measures. Numbers. You
know,&nbsp;quantities.</p>
<p>The movement is dangerous in at least three ways. Firstly and most
obviously, many of the things being measured haven&#8217;t been validated
in prospective trials. They are either (poor) conjecture—like tight
glycemic control for type <span class="caps">II</span> diabetics assumed to help because of good
outcomes in type ones (since, you know, a skinny teenager and a morbidly
obese 60-year-old are similar that way.) Or they came out of a corporate
think-tank cocaine-fueled outside-the-box brainstorming session, like
patient satisfaction scores<sup id="fnref:pg"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:pg" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if they were the best measures in the world, tying them
to promotion and compensation would have the unintended consequence
of having practitioners loose sight of all other aspects of medicine,
including the patient. There are many accounts of how it can
happen—<a href="http://www.medrants.com/archives/8134">this one from Dr. Centor comes readily to mind</a>—but
since (1) identifying and (2) addressing the patient&#8217;s actual problem is
difficult to measure objectively, it is not one of the&nbsp;benchmarks.</p>
<p>And finally, wherever there are numbers and money, techniques will
evolve to game the system. <a href="http://davidsimon.com/the-bad-math/">David Simon&#8217;s account of how this happens
in law enforcement</a> is applicable. Want fewer central line
infections? Enact a policy not to draw blood cultures from central
lines! Too many nosocomial urinary tract infections? Urinalyses on
admission for everyone! Hospitals create teams with dozens of people
whose only job is to find new and better ways to do this. And they have
to—because everyone else is doing it. A depressing amount of time,
money, and effort wasted because of pointless exercises of anonymous&nbsp;pencil-pushers.</p>
<p>This is how you get to <a href="http://thedoctorweighsin.com/the-rise-of-the-machine-how-hospitalpractice-admins-have-assumed-control/">a near 3000% increase in the number of hospital
administrators over 30 years</a>. I am sure they are all good
people, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/sunday-review/doctors-salaries-are-not-the-big-cost.html">with good salaries</a>, but they are, for the most part,
insignificant. An epiphenomenon induced by someone&#8217;s desire to turn
healthcare into an industry, forgetting that the six sigma ideology that
works so well for toaster ovens can&#8217;t be forced onto moist, squishy, and
fragile&nbsp;humans.</p>
<p>Which is also a good working definition of quality&nbsp;improvement.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2015/05/07/talk-therapy/">Talk&nbsp;therapy</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>She makes the mistake of talking to&nbsp;patients.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8212; <cite>Overheard from a fellow discussing the consult attending&#8217;s rounding
habits</cite></p>
<p>Is there such a thing as spending too much time with a patient? The
question seems preposterous, when recent time motion studies showed
that physicians in general, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595927">and residents in particular</a>, clock
embarrassingly few face-to-face minutes. The quote above was said with
a wink and a nudge, but there are situations when it can be true,
particularly if you talk <em>to</em> a patient—or <em>get talked to</em>—instead of
having a&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>Two groups are at highest risk of talking too much—trainees and
consultants. Many an internist remembers having to pick up the pieces
after a consulting physician flew by the bedside to throw an unasked
for opinion bomb. Think hematologists talking about insulin regimens,
cardiologists about causes and treatment of back pain, or orthopedic
surgeons about code status. &#8220;But one doctor said…&#8221; and a perplexed look
is the usual outcome, more so if the consultant debated him or herself
out&nbsp;loud.</p>
<p>Fellows are even more efficient sowers of confusion. Unlike some of
their superiors, they still remember other fields well enough to a) have
a valid opinion, and b) keep it to themselves. Where they are at highest
risk for foot-in-mouth is the area of their future expertise—picking up
just enough from the attendings to sound knowledgeable, yet not knowing
enough to tell the patient what they don&#8217;t know. Even at later stages
of training, a fellow&#8217;s best plan shared with the patient may tumble
down when the attending gives a diametrically opposed recommendation.
The common scenario is one in which there is no evidence, and clinical
judgment rules. You can either not share your own view, or punctuate
every conversation with &#8220;But we&#8217;ll see what my attending says.&#8221; More
time wasted, and for&nbsp;nothing.</p>
<p>Patients themselves can be talkative, sometimes to their detriment.
The reasons are many, and understandable: they have much to say about
themselves—relevant to why they are in the hospital and not so much,
they might not have anyone at home listening, they may have some level
of delirium, dementia, or other cognitive disorder. Being able to
identify such a person, and then knowing how to direct the conversation,
is an unknown skill for most trainees and goes against today&#8217;s dogma
of giving patients time to talk. No harm done to the chatty ones, but
there are only so many hours in the day, and some of them should be
spent&nbsp;thinking.</p>
<p>To be clear, we don&#8217;t have an epidemic of young doctors staying in the
hospital until 2am while demented World War <span class="caps">II</span> veterans regail them with
half-made up stories from Normandy. If only. But more isn&#8217;t always
better, and physicians need to know when to speak up (to get their patient
back on the topic), and when to stay quiet (not to overwhelm them with
half-baked&nbsp;ideas).</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2015/04/11/ultrasubspecialization/">The pitfalls of&nbsp;ultrasubspecialization</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>If you haven&#8217;t yet seen <a href="http://cancerfilms.org/">the new <span class="caps">PBS</span> documentary on Cancer</a>, do it as
soon as possible. A free stream is available <a href="http://video.pbs.org/program/story-cancer-emperor-all-maladies/">on the <span class="caps">PBS</span> website</a>
but it is well worth the $15 on&nbsp;iTunes.</p>
<p>It makes many good points, one of which is the siliness of viewing
cancer in general, or of any particular organ, as being a single
entity. Genitourinary and <span class="caps">GYN</span> malignancies are sill fresh in my
mind after this last rotation, so an example that comes first is
prostate cancer. Most have your standard testosterone-dependent, androgen
deprivation therapy-sensitive cells. Once they stop responding to
hormonal therapy, treatment is still targeted towards the (now mutated)
androgen receptor. Small cell prostate cancer, however, looks and
behaves differently—tending to be bulkier, more aggressive, and having
earlier visceral organ metastases. Ultimately, we treat it more like its
namesake in the lung, with cisplatin and&nbsp;etoposide.</p>
<p>That was an easy distinction to make, since small cell prostate cancer
looks nothing like adenocarcinoma under a microscope. Not so for
breast cancer. We now know that it is at least four diseases which are
at first glance all the same: luminal A (hormone receptor-positive,
Her2-negaitve); luminal B (<span class="caps">HR</span>-positive, Her2-positive); <span class="caps">HR</span>-negative,
Her2-positive; and triple-negative (also called basal-like, though
definitions of basal-like breast cancer vary). The first three, which
we are now able to distinguish with immunohistochemistry and <span class="caps">FISH</span>,
have different behaviour, treatment, and prognosis. The fourth is
a catch-all category that probably contains many different diseases we
don&#8217;t know about yet. Some of those triple-negatives may have more in
common with colon or lung cancer than they do with other malignancies of
the&nbsp;breast.</p>
<p>Which organ the cancer is in should be important to a surgeon or a
radiation oncologist, who have to deal with the anatomy. But should
medical oncologists subspecialize by organ, or by cell? Why is a
neuro-oncologist better suited to treat primary <span class="caps">CNS</span> lymphoma than
a hematologist whose main interest are aggresive lymphomas? Does a
<span class="caps">GI</span> oncologist have a better skillset and knowledge base for dealing
with neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas than an oncologist who
deals with endocrine gland malignancies? Are there other, not so obvious
connections between different cancers that we are missing because of&nbsp;ultrasubspecialization?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough oncology to answer any of these questions, but they
are interesting questions to&nbsp;make.</p>

<p><strong>22.9</strong> Apps that calculate medicinal dosages must be submitted by the

<p>Nevermind that many doctors view themselves as institutions—this is

what I had learned, a single post may not be enough for breast
cancer. Six weeks ago, I knew that it was <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/probability-breast-cancer">common</a>, maybe
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening/breast/HealthProfessional/page8#_423_toc">overdiagnosed</a>, possibly <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.28260/full">overtreated</a>,

enough to know that I need to know more; but also enough to

intricate work of knowing your patient, figuring out where she stands in
the heaps of data generated by decades-long studies following thousands
of women on different protocols, discussing the options, and coming to a
mutualy agreed decision<sup id="fnref:preposterous"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:preposterous" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Hard work, all of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Harder still is working on those data-generating trials. Anyone can
think of a clinicaly relevant question, but can they make it into a
feasable protocol? Can they gather a team to manage all the patients in
the center, and all the different centers? Can they manage that team?
