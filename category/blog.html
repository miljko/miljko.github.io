                <div class="summary"><p>Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma is an often misunderstood disease. You don&#8217;t need to have <span class="caps">AIDS</span> to get it; if it is <span class="caps">AIDS</span>-associated it doesn&#8217;t always disappear with antiretroviral therapy; and if it does it may come back years later. Even oncologists in the <span class="caps">US</span> don&#8217;t see it often, let alone podiatrists—hence some bizare treatment recommendations in the slides&nbsp;below.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2015/04/11/ultrasubspecialization/">The pitfalls of&nbsp;ultrasubspecialization</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>If you haven&#8217;t yet seen <a href="http://cancerfilms.org/">the new <span class="caps">PBS</span> documentary on Cancer</a>, do it as
soon as possible. A free stream is available <a href="http://video.pbs.org/program/story-cancer-emperor-all-maladies/">on the <span class="caps">PBS</span> website</a>
but it is well worth the $15 on&nbsp;iTunes.</p>
<p>It makes many good points, one of which is the siliness of viewing
cancer in general, or of any particular organ, as being a single
entity. Genitourinary and <span class="caps">GYN</span> malignancies are sill fresh in my
mind after this last rotation, so an example that comes first is
prostate cancer. Most have your standard testosterone-dependent, androgen
deprivation therapy-sensitive cells. Once they stop responding to
hormonal therapy, treatment is still targeted towards the (now mutated)
androgen receptor. Small cell prostate cancer, however, looks and
behaves differently—tending to be bulkier, more aggressive, and having
earlier visceral organ metastases. Ultimately, we treat it more like its
namesake in the lung, with cisplatin and&nbsp;etoposide.</p>
<p>That was an easy distinction to make, since small cell prostate cancer
looks nothing like adenocarcinoma under a microscope. Not so for
breast cancer. We now know that it is at least four diseases which are
at first glance all the same: luminal A (hormone receptor-positive,
Her2-negaitve); luminal B (<span class="caps">HR</span>-positive, Her2-positive); <span class="caps">HR</span>-negative,
Her2-positive; and triple-negative (also called basal-like, though
definitions of basal-like breast cancer vary). The first three, which
we are now able to distinguish with immunohistochemistry and <span class="caps">FISH</span>,
have different behaviour, treatment, and prognosis. The fourth is
a catch-all category that probably contains many different diseases we
don&#8217;t know about yet. Some of those triple-negatives may have more in
common with colon or lung cancer than they do with other malignancies of
the&nbsp;breast.</p>
<p>Which organ the cancer is in should be important to a surgeon or a
radiation oncologist, who have to deal with the anatomy. But should
medical oncologists subspecialize by organ, or by cell? Why is a
neuro-oncologist better suited to treat primary <span class="caps">CNS</span> lymphoma than
a hematologist whose main interest are aggresive lymphomas? Does a
<span class="caps">GI</span> oncologist have a better skillset and knowledge base for dealing
with neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas than an oncologist who
deals with endocrine gland malignancies? Are there other, not so obvious
connections between different cancers that we are missing because of&nbsp;ultrasubspecialization?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough oncology to answer any of these questions, but they
are interesting questions to&nbsp;make.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>First they came for the <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/06/08/editorial-1-1-1-rejected-from-the-app-store/">nerds</a>.</p>
<p>Now they are <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id806809930?at=1l3v3Zp">coming for the doctors</a> (see What&#8217;s New in Version 3.0.5).
The makers of MedCalc, the best medical calculator app out there, <a href="http://medcalc.medserver.be/dosegate.html">explained
what happend</a> in detail<sup id="fnref:dosegate"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dosegate" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This was the rule they were
supposedly&nbsp;infringing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>22.9</strong> Apps that calculate medicinal dosages must be submitted by the
manufacturer of those medications or recognized institutions such as
hospitals, insurance companies, and&nbsp;universities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevermind that many doctors view themselves as institutions—this is
an idiotic rule. Is University of Baltimore, which has no biomedical
science courses or programs, allowed to publish a drug dose calculator?
Is <span class="caps">GEICO</span>?</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FDA</span> has issued <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../UCM263366.pdf">guidance for mobile medical apps</a>. It
specificaly allows calculators that use generally available formulas,
and forbids apps which calculate <em>radiation</em> dosage, but does not
mention drugs. Where, then, did this rule come&nbsp;from?</p>
<p>It is, of course, the same App store rules that allowed <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homeopathy-cures/id479869465?mt=8">these</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/homeopathy-materia-medica/id623045549?mt=8">pearls</a>

                <div class="summary"><p>If the unstated goal of these rotation post-mortems was to summarize
what I had learned, a single post may not be enough for breast
cancer. Six weeks ago, I knew that it was <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/detection/probability-breast-cancer">common</a>, maybe
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening/breast/HealthProfessional/page8#_423_toc">overdiagnosed</a>, possibly <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.28260/full">overtreated</a>,
and <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-funding">beating all other cancers for research funding by a vast
margin</a>. All this was a vague sense of being informed—like a
<span class="caps">NYT</span> reader may feel after reading the Sunday Magazine feature—rather than
actual&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
<p>Having talked to a good number of women with breast cancer, and
worked with a few attendings dedicated to the field, I know it
enough to know that I need to know more; but also enough to
keep me interested. What from the outside looks like cookbook
<em>this-marker-means-she&#8217;s-getting-that-treatment</em> medicine is in fact an
intricate work of knowing your patient, figuring out where she stands in
the heaps of data generated by decades-long studies following thousands
of women on different protocols, discussing the options, and coming to a
mutualy agreed decision<sup id="fnref:preposterous"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:preposterous" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Hard work, all of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Harder still is working on those data-generating trials. Anyone can
think of a clinicaly relevant question, but can they make it into a
feasable protocol? Can they gather a team to manage all the patients in
the center, and all the different centers? Can they manage that team?
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/NCI/research-funding">Looking at a recent set of trials you will hear more about soon</a>,
the scale boggles the&nbsp;mind.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>The rotation is called malignant hematology, but between Thanksgiving,
Christmas, New Year&#8217;s, and everyone being away for <span class="caps">ASH</span>, it was a joke.
The only memorable part were the first two weeks—the oncology consults
at Georgetown—which reminded me that the <span class="caps">NIH</span> was indeed an ivory
tower. This is compared to a well-known academic center. Compared to
a community hospital—<a href="http://www.lifebridgehealth.org/Sinai/Sinai1.aspx?cpsys_redirect=404">my last employer being a good example</a>,
though you may find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Stroger,_Jr._Hospital_of_Cook_County">much better</a>—the Institutes in general and
the Clinical Center in particular are a tower of crystalized angel
tears sitting high on top of a mountain range on Mars. This is neither
criticism nor praise, but a statement of fact<sup id="fnref:tears"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tears" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Having only spent four days on Georgetown consult service, I would
rather not comment<sup id="fnref:bad"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:bad" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. But here are ten things about the inpatient
side of my home institution that might interest the outside&nbsp;world:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is only one <span class="caps">EMR</span> and no paper&nbsp;charts;</li>
<li>Someone else, most commonly the research nurse, will obtain the outside
  records and have them scanned in—so the <span class="caps">EMR</span> is the only place you need to look
  for&nbsp;anything;</li>
<li>There are usually no medical students, interns, or residents—it&#8217;s the <span class="caps">NP</span>/<span class="caps">PA</span>,
  fellow, and the attending running the&nbsp;show;</li>
<li>Remember the 3am page from the nurse asking for a Tylenol order? If it is for
  someone on a phase 1 trial, you&#8217;d better check the protocol and call the
  attending before giving&nbsp;it;</li>
<li>Patients can be &#8220;out on pass&#8221;—meaning they can leave the campus for up to
  20-something days and still count as an inpatient, without needing to be
  discharged and&nbsp;readmitted;</li>
<li>If a patient needs to stay an extra day or two because of transport issues, 
  nobody blinks an&nbsp;eye;</li>
<li>For three to to five days you will get weird looks if it is your patient, but
  there will be no passive-aggresive emails about the hospital not getting&nbsp;reimbursement;</li>
<li>If it is six days or more it is likely they are homeless—social work will be on&nbsp;it;</li>
<li>Ordering most imaging—ultrasounds, CTs, MRIs, etc—requires two steps: getting
  a time-slot from central scheduling, or the tech on call if it is a same-day
  scan, and putting in the order. Think about the implications and let it sink&nbsp;in;</li>
<li>All discharge medications are dispensed from the outpatient pharmacy free of
  charge to the patient. Yes, all of&nbsp;them;</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people treated at the Clinical Center are trial participants who
are sick, rather than &#8220;just&#8221; patients. There are no administrative or financial
pressures, no dealings with insurance companies, and not much concern with
disposition. As you can imagine, this makes for a beautiful work&nbsp;environment.</p>
