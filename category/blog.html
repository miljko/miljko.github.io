                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2017/12/27/unpopular-opinions-2/">What I believe that most people probably don’t (no data behind this, just the&nbsp;armchair)</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>The world in general, and the <span class="caps">US</span> in particular, is spending too much on goal-directed, targeted biomedical research while undervaluing both applied and theoretical physics. Picture <a href="http://www.da-vinci-inventions.com/aerial-screw.aspx">Leonardo da Vinci drawing helicopters</a>: that’s the modern-day cancer researcher. The universal cure for cancer — and there should be one, if humanity survives long enough to create it — will not come from an <span class="caps">NIH</span> grant. If grants are involved at all, it will be something initially funded by the National Science Foundation. The current system of funding (government, non-profit, biotech, you name it) is broken, and if you account for the opportunity cost it is a complete disaster. Each of these statements deserves at least a paragraph, but I am saving my carpal tunnels for a manuscript, an <span class="caps">LOI</span>, and a couple of protocols (oh, the&nbsp;irony). </p>
<p>In the meantime, a few things physician-scientists should do for the overall good:
<em> find causes and create better prevention strategies, because a look at the <span class="caps">SEER</span> database will tell you that it’s not just bad luck;
</em> eliminate barriers for administration of known curative therapies world-wide (do we really want to leave this to politicians and economists?);
* ensure <em>rapid</em> and <em>honest</em> evaluation of the many new treatments, procedures, and diagnostic/prognostic methods coming out of the biomedical&nbsp;behemoth.</p>
<p>How beneficial any of this would be for one’s career is a different question altogether, but let’s not get into incentives because <span class="caps">RSI</span>. I am also very open to opposing opinions, since my being wrong would make my life&nbsp;easier.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Serbia’s public broadcaster, <span class="caps">RTS</span> (that’s <span class="caps">PTC</span> in cyrillic) has a good chunk of its archive <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/RTSSajtZvanicniKanal">spread</a> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/KulturnoUmetnickiRTS">across</a> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/ObrazovnoNaucniRTS">multiple</a> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/UmetnickaMuzikaRTS">YouTube</a> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SecanjeNaEKVRTS">channels</a>, and it is magnificent (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC7AVHSW03R-VipxbLnVXobQ">this one in particular</a>).</p>
<p>Observe <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbMnBfiy6iFYce7cJRbZUVPvueGADTt3">the 1960s-1990s televised plays and <span class="caps">TV</span> dramas</a>. I still have vivid memories of watching one particular <em>product</em> the first time it aired, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w1oic-oTVOc">about a Serbian family keeping in touch with their ex-pat relatives in Germany via <span class="caps">VHS</span> tapes</a>. Replace camcorders with smart phones and speed up the timeline to account for the internet, and it could have been shot today. Technology changes, people&nbsp;don’t.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HMr6sRAxl1GfI1vtEbznKzfQHEYQo5">My favorite childhood <span class="caps">TV</span> show</a> hasn’t aged well at all; then again has anything from the ‘90s? If you consider most of it was made during a civil war and in a time of hyperinflation it is actually quite good. What was 90210’s excuse? Better kids’ shows have been made in Serbia both <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6HMr6sRAxkthNVJMLxJCcPCrndbXPJ_">before</a> and <a href="https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxbMnBfiy6iH2TZq6DzM2fX485rDJcpdw">after</a>.</p>
<p>Best for last: the celebration of hard core nerddom that is Serbia’s longest-running quiz show, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SlagalicaRTS">important enough to have its own channel</a>. It starts with anagrams and math problems, makes a detour to Mastermind, then finishes off with three different ways to test for trivia. Jokes about the autism spectrum would be writing themselves if this were an American show, but it’s not, and (before I left, at least) Serbian viewers still had some admiration for the participants. It is all very serious and competitive, and has been on the air every weekday for the last 24 years. (A political side-note: this does not mean Serbia is free from anti-intellectualism, quite the opposite in fact. Some combination of militant anti-intellectuals, gas-lighters, and proponents of economic/financial scientism has been in positions of power since the early 90s. There are no lessons here, just&nbsp;observations). </p>

                <div class="summary"><p>For better or worse, the American system of government is strong. Those who say otherwise have a financial interest in people thinking the&nbsp;opposite.</p>
<p>Culturally, <span class="caps">US</span> has more similarities with Iran than with Saudi Arabia, even if you count religion and religiosity as part of culture. The Christian right is working hard to make them even more&nbsp;similar.</p>
<p>Though still quite hard, it’s easier for a high-skilled immigrant to come to America than to any other country in the world. Comparison is even more favorable for low-skilled and unskilled immigrants. For all of them, quality of life, acceptance, and protection they get are better than anywhere&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>The randomness of the Green Card lottery process is a feature not a&nbsp;bug.</p>
<p>Reading the non-fiction sections of The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and whatever their conservative equivalents are, is good for generating fake insight but ultimately pointless. The Economist is useful for a tiny segment of the population but lets be real: if you’re reading this you are not&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The only useful section in the daily newspapers is Local. Maybe Sports, if you are into that sort of thing, but professional and college sports are a scam so stick with the amateur&nbsp;leagues.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TSA</span> agents and airline personnel are nice people but some passengers check out their brains at the curb and make everyone’s lives less&nbsp;pleasant.</p>
<p>Apple hardware products are underpriced for what you get but do you actually need what they offer? This doesn’t include the AirPods, which are the best thing Apple has made in the last 20 years and still underpriced; though they unfortunately resemble in both name and appearance <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/EarPod">a mind control method from Doctor Who S2</a> and paired with a smart phone are not far from&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The world doesn’t need another <span class="caps">IPA</span>. America needs more&nbsp;tripels.</p>
<p>This is all coming from a non-immigrant resident alien with no expertise in politics, international law, transportation, or technology. I do know beer&nbsp;though.</p>

<li><strong>Conversations with Tyler:</strong> I much prefer this over his mostly spartan, often cryptic, and <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/12/seven-forbidden-words.html">always clueless about things medical</a> blog Marginal revolution. Cowen‘s interview style brings out the best from people; it is also a good and rare example of clear thinking. Compare and contrast <a href="https://overcast.fm/+EdFzVYa0A">his chat with Malcolm Gladwell</a> and <a href="https://overcast.fm/+EdFz2WcLQ">Patrick Collison’s chat with Cowen</a>: when answering, Gladwell uhms and ahhs and changes direction mid-sentence; Cowen pauses for a half-second, then produces paragraphs of prose that could have been lifted right out of an encyclopedia. Not to belittle Gladwell —  for one, I’d be even worse (as anyone who had to finish my sentences for me can confirm); and two, he is responsible&nbsp;for</li>
<li><strong>Revisionist history:</strong> He had me at <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Gsa28yPC8">Food Fight</a>. Gladwell embraces and owns his <em>Well, actually</em> kind of story-telling — even the show’s name is a big <em>Well, actually</em> to the Gladwell-haters. And good for him, because the stories are marvelous in both topic and style, and make me want to read his books&nbsp;again.</li>
<li><strong>Sources and methods:</strong> Two ex-spies talk about learning and cognition. They are still in  intelligence-gathering mode, interviewing guests you‘re unlikely to hear anywhere else. <a href="https://overcast.fm/+DYZ4H4LSA">It’s how I learned about Tinderbox</a> (and you can&nbsp;too). </li>
<li><strong>America the bilingual:</strong> One part <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Iu8IpAoU4">pep-talk to encourage the pre-1990s waves of immigrants to America to take up a second language</a>, one part <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Iu8JtGW2s">advice to parents raising multilingual children</a>. The latter validated my plan to ~~save money~~ strengthen the offspring’s Serbian by shipping them across the Atlantic to spend some quality time with the&nbsp;grandparents.</li>
<li><strong>Novel targets:</strong> Finishing of the list of men talking to each other is the best oncology podcast I’ve come across. It may be <a href="https://overcast.fm/+EcDGBRIqo">heavily slanted towards immunotherapy</a>, and not zealous enough in dampening the hype, but it&nbsp;tries.</li>

<p>Restaurants with street seating. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m back in Belgrade. Alas, most of them serve nothing but greasy American classics, only they call it Southern-style and put even more&nbsp;grease.</p>
<p>Are people who eat at these places the same ones doing all the&nbsp;running?</p>

<p>When I was a house officer and installing one of the first right-heart
catheters, the machine that showed intrapulmonic arterial pressures was
enormous and was equipped with strain gauges rather than computer chips.
Making it work was difficult. After the line was in, the attending, the
nurse, and I tried desperately to adjust the machine to show the pulmonary
arterial pressure waves. We could not get them. The line on the screen
remained flat. We manipulated toggle switches and strain gauges for about 15
minutes. Nothing. Finally, I glanced at the patient: He was&nbsp;dead.</p>

After that, though, you will have to juggle patient care, research, didactics, fellowship/career planning, and piles of administrative drek—and that&#8217;s just inside the hospital.
