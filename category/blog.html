                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/handling-email/">How I handle email (which is not how everyone should, but you may find some of these&nbsp;useful)</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>This is all about work email. I have succeeded in transferring most personal communication to Slack, iMessage, and WhatsApp, with a sprinkling of Skype for the grandparents. The sole holdout is Dad, who insists on emailing me links to Serbian tabloid news, child rearing advice, and&nbsp;recipes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">Inbox Zero</a> is a great idea in its original form: live you life and write your emails in a way that solicits as few return emails to you as possible. It means giving some thought to what you put in your responses, and being clear and definitive about them. It doesn’t mean mindlessly deleting or archiving everything or, even worse, sending out half-baked replies just to pass on the baton when you’ll get a dozen of them in&nbsp;return.</p>
<p>I only check email twice a week day and once on a weekend, and with the explicit intent to clean out the inbox (unless when on service or when I’m the primary attending for a sick inpatient). Never check email “just to see what’s there” unless you have the time and the means to do something about whatever you’ll find. More than once in the past I was left to sour over an unexpected administrative roadblock or a non-urgent patient care calamity during a family event, when I could have just as easily waited for Monday&nbsp;morning.</p>
<p>When scheduling meetings: <a href="https://doodle.com/">Doodle</a> (or your preferred equivalent) for more than three people, email is fine for 1 or 2. If using email and I’m scheduling, proposed times, location, and a tentative agenda are all in the initial email. If I’m responding to a meeting request I try to put all of those in my reply, but that also depends on who’s&nbsp;requesting.</p>
<p>I thank in advance, not after the fact, and rarely send emails whose sole purpose is to give&nbsp;thanks.</p>
<p>If I get an unsolicited and unexpected email from someone I don’t know but that’s not obviously a mass posting, I wait for the second one. Most times it never&nbsp;arrives.</p>
<p>If the email looks like it came from a template it gets deleted without being&nbsp;read.</p>
<p>If I am cc’d on an email chain with many recipients and not directly called out, I archive and wait it out. The only exception is when I know that one or two replies from me would be able to end the game of email chicken that these chains tend to&nbsp;become.</p>
<p>The few times that I didn’t follow these guidelines, I came to regret it (<a href="https://fs.blog/2017/05/confirmation-bias/">confirmation bias</a> warning!). I’m sure plenty of people don’t give it a second thought and go by just fine. But they probably don’t work in health&nbsp;care.</p>

<li><a href="http://soundcloud.com/plenarysession">Plenary Session</a>. Many friends and coworkers are amazed that anyone would voluntarily subject themself to Vinay Prasad‘s tirades, but his podcast is well-behaved and a pleasure to listen. The monologues are better than the interviews, which is to be expected: he’s been monologuing his whole life and interviewing for less than a year. And yes, some of his guests/collaborators need too much coaxing, but sock puppets only reinforce the national meeting atmosphere that the name&nbsp;evokes.</li>

You can start at the beginning, or with <a href="https://overcast.fm/+PbpIQwDV4">the one with Daniel Kahneman</a>, but start somewhere.

                <div class="summary"><ol>
<li>Science and the real world: Too many abstracts touted their “real-world” data meaning to say their analysis was retrospective. No shame in a well-done chart review, but calling it “the real world” dilutes the phrase. When the <span class="caps">NCI</span> director referred to real world data in his not-well-enough-attended <span class="caps">ASH</span> speech, it was to describe prospective collection of structured data in routine clinical practice. It can also be used to describe pragmatic clinical trials, with looser eligibility criteria and fewer treatment restrictions. The “real world” abstracts I saw were&nbsp;neither.</li>
<li>Steve Horwitz’s weird weekend: How many oral abstracts can one person have in a single meeting? Apparently, four; three of which were spread over two T-cell lymphoma sessions held on the same day. These were all multi-center trials, one global, so not exactly venues where one may cede the podium to their mentee (some of whom had their own orals to deal with). But&nbsp;sheesh.</li>
<li>T-cell lymphomas have their day (maybe?): The global trial was <span class="caps">ECHELON</span>-2, and it showed an overall survival benefit of first-line brentuximab vedotin + <span class="caps">CHP</span> over <span class="caps">CHOP</span> in <span class="caps">CD30</span>+ T-cell lymphoma. Which is great, only ~80% of patients in the control arm did not get <span class="caps">BV</span> on progression due to the trial being global and <span class="caps">BV</span> not being available in most of the countries. There were several more would-be flies in the ointment, but <span class="caps">US</span> <span class="caps">FDA</span> approved <span class="caps">BV</span> for first-line treatment of <span class="caps">CD30</span>+ <span class="caps">TCL</span> even before the paper was out in The Lancet (which was on the day of the talk). Thus the incredible path of data for <span class="caps">BV</span> in first-line <span class="caps">TCL</span> was: press release -&gt; <span class="caps">FDA</span> approval -&gt; Lancet paper -&gt; <span class="caps">ASH</span> oral. Again,&nbsp;sheesh.</li>
<li>Spotlight so bright: I moderated an oral abstract session, and it was fun, but oh wow did the spotlights hurt my eyes. Much respect for anyone who has to stand in front of them&nbsp;professionally.</li>
<li>Let’s have it in San Diego every year, please, and thank&nbsp;you.</li>

                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/il-15-flavors/">The three flavors of&nbsp;interleukin-15</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>One thing I realized at <span class="caps">SITC</span> this year was that not many people know (or care?) about the difference between the <span class="caps">IL</span>-15s now being tested in trials. There are: the recombinant human (rh)<span class="caps">IL</span>-15, the <span class="caps">IL</span>-15/<span class="caps">IL</span>-15Ralpha heterodimer (hetIL-15), and <span class="caps">ALT</span>-803, the “super-agonist”. You’re better of <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019">reading a more comprehensive review</a>, but some highlights are&nbsp;below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The simplest, oldest, and seemingly most potent is the plain vanilla&nbsp;rhIL-15.</li>
<li>Four dosing strategies have so far been tested: bolus (too toxic, <a href="http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2014.57.3329">published</a>), subcutaneous (<span class="caps">OK</span>, about as good as <span class="caps">ALT</span>-803 in increasing NKs and <span class="caps">CD8</span>+ T cells, <a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2017/12/02/1078-0432.CCR-17-2451">also published</a>), 10-day continuous infusion (the most potent, but who wants to sit in a hospital for 10 days, should be published soon), and a 5-day infusion (same 40-fold increase in <span class="caps">NK</span> numbers in half the time! <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/miljko/status/1061004684759056385">presented at <span class="caps">SITC</span></a>)</li>
<li>None of the patients in any of the regimens had a <span class="caps">RECIST</span> response, but most mounted an impressive lymphocytosis, leading to several planned combination&nbsp;trials</li>
<li>
<p>It is available for investigator-initiated studies through <span class="caps">CTEP</span>. They will also give a few vials for preclinical&nbsp;studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Novartis owns hetIL-15, and is running the phase I alone and in combination with their anti-<span class="caps">PD</span>-1. Nothing published, but I’ll have more to say about it next&nbsp;year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="caps">ALT</span>-803 is an <span class="caps">IL</span>-15/<span class="caps">IL</span>-15Ralpha heterodimer blessed with a single point mutation which confers upon it both increased binding to the common gamma chain, and validity to the claim of new <span class="caps">IP</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>It is the only one shown to have efficacy as a single agent (<a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/126/23/1957">though not in solid tumors</a>), and the only one to be part of a published and/or presented combination (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30148-7/fulltext">with nivolumab in <span class="caps">NSCLC</span></a>, and with rituximab in <span class="caps">FL</span>).</li>
<li>What’s presented so far makes it less potent than rhIL-15 in increasing cell counts, but more convenient to give: via once-weekly subcutaneous injections for an 8-fold increase in&nbsp;NKs.</li>
<li>The company, Altor Biosciences, had been fairly open to IITs — one of them is currently open at <span class="caps">NCI</span>’s <span class="caps">GU</span> Malignancies Branch — but maybe not so much since being acquired in August 2018 by NantCell, a Patrick Soon-Shiong&nbsp;company.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s more, of course, but I’ll end instead with another plug for <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/jir.2018.0019">our review</a> of cytokines in cancer&nbsp;therapy.</p>

                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/car-nk-sitc/">Yes, <span class="caps">CAR</span>-<span class="caps">NK</span> cells are exciting (as exciting as they can get after a phase I single-center yet-to-be-published&nbsp;trial)</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>For more than a year now, the big names of <span class="caps">CAR</span>-T-cell world have been sharing their excitement about the potential of <span class="caps">NK</span> cells to be a much better <span class="caps">CAR</span> carrier. There are many hypotheses about why that would be, but you can hypothesize all you want until you give the product to humans. <span class="caps">PET</span> scans can lie, but not nearly as much as your average transgenic mouse&nbsp;model.</p>
<p>Well, anti-<span class="caps">CD19CAR</span>-NKs have now been given to at least 9 humans, <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelodwyerMD/status/1061357814625591296">as reported by Dr. Katy Rezvani</a> from the <span class="caps">MD</span> Anderson Cancer Center at the <a href="https://www.sitcancer.org/education/annualmeeting"><span class="caps">SITC</span> Annual Meeting</a> a few days ago, and what she reported was as good as it gets for a first-in-human trial of a new gene/cellular therapy. The five&nbsp;takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Off-the-shelf cord blood-derived <span class="caps">NK</span> cells carrying a <span class="caps">CAR</span> can safely be given to humans without <span class="caps">HLA</span>-matching. This could decrease both cost and time to&nbsp;treatment.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/stephaniecornen/status/1061365182373523456">None of the nine patients had cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity.</a> After all, <span class="caps">NK</span> cells aren’t big cytokine&nbsp;producers.</li>
<li>Six of nine patients had a complete response and one more had a partial response for a 77% response&nbsp;rate.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/DrMiguelPerales/status/1061414200969494529">One of those CRs and one <span class="caps">PR</span> were patients with <span class="caps">CLL</span> and Richter’s transformation</a>, another <span class="caps">CR</span> was in a 70-year-old with double-hit lymphoma, and yet another in a patient with <span class="caps">CLL</span> and 17p deletion. These are tough&nbsp;diseases.</li>
<li>Contrary to what was hypothesized about <span class="caps">NK</span> cell longevity, the <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs persisted for up to six months after treatment. We still don’t know what that means for <span class="caps">CAR</span>-Ts, let alone <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs, but I consider it a win each time experiment refutes&nbsp;theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yes, I am also excited about <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs.&nbsp;However:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is an unpublished, non-peer-reviewed, single-center experience. There could be research hospitals out there giving <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs with results too horrible, or just too middle-of-the-road, for early&nbsp;promotion.</li>
<li><span class="caps">CLL</span> is notoriously difficult to stage, and five of the nine patients had <span class="caps">CLL</span>. Consider <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1713976">the <span class="caps">MURANO</span> trial</a> (Venetclax-Rituximab combo fo relapsed/refractory <span class="caps">CLL</span>), in which the investigator-assessed complete response rate of 26.8% turned to 8.2% on independent review committee&nbsp;assessment.</li>
<li>Follow-up is limited and it is too early to know the response duration. Long enough to get to an allo transplant, at&nbsp;least?</li>
<li>The same limitations in target availability we have in <span class="caps">CAR</span>-T cells apply to <span class="caps">CAR</span>-NKs. It has to be a surface antigen with limited to no expression on normal cells. There aren’t too many of those, particularly in solid&nbsp;tumors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, kudos to Drs. Rezvani, Shpall, and others at <span class="caps">MD</span> Anderson. This is as good as it gets at this early&nbsp;stage. </p>

                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/unpopular-opinions-2/">What I believe that most people probably don’t (no data behind this, just the&nbsp;armchair)</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>The world in general, and the <span class="caps">US</span> in particular, is spending too much on goal-directed, targeted biomedical research while undervaluing both applied and theoretical physics. Picture <a href="http://www.da-vinci-inventions.com/aerial-screw.aspx">Leonardo da Vinci drawing helicopters</a>: that’s the modern-day cancer researcher. The universal cure for cancer — and there should be one, if humanity survives long enough to create it — will not come from an <span class="caps">NIH</span> grant. If grants are involved at all, it will be something initially funded by the National Science Foundation. The current system of funding (government, non-profit, biotech, you name it) is broken, and if you account for the opportunity cost it is a complete disaster. Each of these statements deserves at least a paragraph, but I am saving my carpal tunnels for a manuscript, an <span class="caps">LOI</span>, and a couple of protocols (oh, the&nbsp;irony). </p>
<p>In the meantime, a few things physician-scientists should do for the overall&nbsp;good:</p>
<ul>
<li>find causes and create better prevention strategies, because a look at the <span class="caps">SEER</span> database will tell you that it’s not just bad&nbsp;luck;</li>
<li>eliminate barriers for administration of known curative therapies world-wide (do we really want to leave this to politicians and&nbsp;economists?);</li>
<li>ensure <em>rapid</em> and <em>honest</em> evaluation of the many new treatments, procedures, and diagnostic/prognostic methods coming out of the biomedical&nbsp;behemoth.</li>
</ul>
<p>How beneficial any of this would be for one’s career is a different question altogether, but let’s not get into incentives because <span class="caps">RSI</span>. I am also very open to opposing opinions, since my being wrong would make my life&nbsp;easier.</p>

<p>Best for last: the celebration of hard core nerddom that is Serbia’s longest-running quiz show, <a href="https://m.youtube.com/user/SlagalicaRTS">important enough to have its own channel</a>. It starts with anagrams and math problems, makes a detour to Mastermind, then finishes off with three different ways to test for trivia. Jokes about the autism spectrum would be writing themselves if this were an American show, but it’s not, and (before I left, at least) Serbian viewers still had some admiration for the participants. It is all very serious and competitive, and has been on the air every weekday for the last 24 years. (A political side-note: this does not mean Serbia is free from anti-intellectualism, quite the opposite in fact. Some combination of militant anti-intellectuals, gas-lighters, and proponents of economic/financial scientism has been in positions of power since the early 90s. There are no lessons here, just&nbsp;observations). </p>

                <h2><a href="https://miljko.org/unpopular-opinions-1/">A few unpopular (in certain circles) opinions from a person who has no rights having&nbsp;them</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>For better or worse, the American system of government is strong. Those who say otherwise have a financial interest in people thinking the&nbsp;opposite.</p>
<p>Culturally, <span class="caps">US</span> has more similarities with Iran than with Saudi Arabia, even if you count religion and religiosity as part of culture. The Christian right is working hard to make them even more&nbsp;similar.</p>
<p>Though still quite hard, it’s easier for a high-skilled immigrant to come to America than to any other country in the world. Comparison is even more favorable for low-skilled and unskilled immigrants. For all of them, quality of life, acceptance, and protection they get are better than anywhere&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>The randomness of the Green Card lottery process is a feature not a&nbsp;bug.</p>
<p>Reading the non-fiction sections of The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and whatever their conservative equivalents are, is good for generating fake insight but ultimately pointless. The Economist is useful for a tiny segment of the population but lets be real: if you’re reading this you are not&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The only useful section in the daily newspapers is Local. Maybe Sports, if you are into that sort of thing, but professional and college sports are a scam so stick with the amateur&nbsp;leagues.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TSA</span> agents and airline personnel are nice people but some passengers check out their brains at the curb and make everyone’s lives less&nbsp;pleasant.</p>
<p>Apple hardware products are underpriced for what you get but do you actually need what they offer? This doesn’t include the AirPods, which are the best thing Apple has made in the last 20 years and still underpriced; though they unfortunately resemble in both name and appearance <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/EarPod">a mind control method from Doctor Who S2</a> and paired with a smart phone are not far from&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The world doesn’t need another <span class="caps">IPA</span>. America needs more&nbsp;tripels.</p>
<p>This is all coming from a non-immigrant resident alien with no expertise in politics, international law, transportation, or technology. I do know beer&nbsp;though.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>(voices as in podcasts, not a psychotic&nbsp;episodes)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conversations with Tyler:</strong> I much prefer this over his mostly spartan, often cryptic, and <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2017/12/seven-forbidden-words.html">always clueless about things medical</a> blog Marginal revolution. Cowen‘s interview style brings out the best from people; it is also a good and rare example of clear thinking. Compare and contrast <a href="https://overcast.fm/+EdFzVYa0A">his chat with Malcolm Gladwell</a> and <a href="https://overcast.fm/+EdFz2WcLQ">Patrick Collison’s chat with Cowen</a>: when answering, Gladwell uhms and ahhs and changes direction mid-sentence; Cowen pauses for a half-second, then produces paragraphs of prose that could have been lifted right out of an encyclopedia. Not to belittle Gladwell —  for one, I’d be even worse (as anyone who had to finish my sentences for me can confirm); and two, he is responsible&nbsp;for</li>
<li><strong>Revisionist history:</strong> He had me at <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Gsa28yPC8">Food Fight</a>. Gladwell embraces and owns his <em>Well, actually</em> kind of story-telling — even the show’s name is a big <em>Well, actually</em> to the Gladwell-haters. And good for him, because the stories are marvelous in both topic and style, and make me want to read his books&nbsp;again.</li>
<li><strong>Sources and methods:</strong> Two ex-spies talk about learning and cognition. They are still in  intelligence-gathering mode, interviewing guests you‘re unlikely to hear anywhere else. <a href="https://overcast.fm/+DYZ4H4LSA">It’s how I learned about Tinderbox</a> (and you can&nbsp;too). </li>
<li><strong>America the bilingual:</strong> One part <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Iu8IpAoU4">pep-talk to encourage the pre-1990s waves of immigrants to America to take up a second language</a>, one part <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Iu8JtGW2s">advice to parents raising multilingual children</a>. The latter validated my plan to ~~save money~~ strengthen the offspring’s Serbian by shipping them across the Atlantic to spend some quality time with the&nbsp;grandparents.</li>
<li><strong>Novel targets:</strong> Finishing of the list of men talking to each other is the best oncology podcast I’ve come across. It may be <a href="https://overcast.fm/+EcDGBRIqo">heavily slanted towards immunotherapy</a>, and not zealous enough in dampening the hype, but it&nbsp;tries.</li>

                <div class="summary"><p>I have cut my commute down to 40 minutes door-door (from ~2 hours), 25 of which are walking, and we only have to pay 1.69 times the rent.&nbsp;Yay?</p>
<p>Some observations about our new neighborhood from a Serbian/European/Baltimorean&nbsp;transplant.</p>
<p>Dogs are&nbsp;everywhere.</p>
<p>Runners and cyclists&nbsp;too. </p>
<p>And a couple of homeless people. One seems to have staked out a bench I pass by every&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Very few children. Assuming all the little Audreys and Maddisons are attending their ballet lessons, or&nbsp;whatnot.</p>
<p>Restaurants with street seating. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m back in Belgrade. Alas, most of them serve nothing but greasy American classics, only they call it Southern-style and put even more&nbsp;grease.</p>
<p>Are people who eat at these places the same ones doing all the&nbsp;running?</p>
<p>Why do two different streets in the same neighborhood have the exact same name? If you put a super-block that cuts a road in half, does it not make sense to rename one of&nbsp;them?</p>
<p>Safeway is a&nbsp;dump.</p>
<p>The title may remind you of <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/07/the-culture-that-is-kansas.html">Marginal revolution</a>. That&#8217;s on purpose. Go read&nbsp;it.</p>
