                <div class="summary"><p>Observe George Carlin discussing how euphemisms are invading the English&nbsp;language:</p>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/vuEQixrBKCc"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I first heard a version of this years ago, back in Serbia, while I was still
a med student. It hadn&#8217;t left much of an impression, but I can imagine myself
nodding my head and thinking <em>ha ha, yes, stupid Americans, ruining their own
language</em>, or something comparably&nbsp;obnoxious.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve, erm, matured since then. True, some euphemisms now inspire
rage instead of vague amusement, like my two&nbsp;favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I just wanted to let you know&#8221; instead of &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you&#8221;, and its
  relatives &#8220;Please let me know&#8221;, and &#8220;Thank you for letting me know&#8221;.
  Physicians are particularly fond of this, for we are the gatekeepers of
  knowledge, and the only reason you know something is because we are letting
  you. Don&#8217;t worry though, it&#8217;s not just you, we say that to each other all the&nbsp;time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I don&#8217;t feel comfortable doing xyz&#8221; instead of &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do
  xyz&#8221;, <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/25/ten-common-residency-idioms-and-phrases">as mentioned here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of them, though—particularly ones we use with patients—have a good
reason to exist. <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/translation/">The Radiolab segment which inspired this post</a>
made fun of &#8220;making someone comfortable&#8221; being used for dying <span class="caps">ICU</span> patients.
Instead of… what, exactly? Euthanasia? There is a difference between giving
someone drugs usualy meant for comfort—opioids, primarily—in order to kill them,
and giving them opioids for pain and comfort knowing it may shorten their&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Then there are turns of phrase used <em>because</em> they are euphemisms. &#8220;You
should get your affairs in order&#8221;, &#8220;your time is becoming limited&#8221;, &#8220;at
this point we should concentrate on quality of life, not quantity&#8221; are
all ways of saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when you&#8217;ll die, but it will be soon,
so start planning the funeral&#8221;. I am sure Mr. Carlin would appreciate
getting it straight, but not every patient is as stoic. We can easily
be more blunt if asked to do so, but you cannot un-hit a patient with a
sledgehammer like that. So the default is to err on the side of&nbsp;softness.</p>
<p>Then again, most of the euphemisms we use with patients also make <em>us</em>
more comfortable with the sitation. What I wrote above may then just be
my rationalizing it away with a convenient it&#8217;s-best-for-the-patient
mantra. In truth—to use another common phrase—euphemisitis is a
<em>multifactorial</em> condition (as in, I have no idea what the reasons are,
but it&#8217;s probably a little bit of&nbsp;everything).</p>

<p>The final two slides, after the thank-you slide, are there just in case. I try

                <div class="summary"><p>Here is a slide show I had to make during my <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/10/10/pain-and-palliation/">pain and palliative
rotation</a>, which ended up being an updated rehash of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24051618">a review
article I wrote for Cancer Journal on the history of end-of-life
care</a>. The article itself is behind a paywall, but you can
find the <span class="caps">PDF</span> on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256837323_From_the_Euthanasia_Society_to_Physician_Orders_for_Life-Sustaining_Treatment_End-of-Life_Care_in_the_United_States">ResearchGate</a>.</p>
<p>When thinking about end-of-life care, and care for the sick patient in general,
what most physicians worry about&nbsp;is:</p>
<ul>
<li>how not to kill the&nbsp;patient</li>
<li>how to actually help the&nbsp;patient</li>
<li>how not to get into trouble while doing the first&nbsp;two</li>
</ul>
<p>As you will see in the slides, all laws currently in place are
there to help you with that last thing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel">Death panels</a> notwithstanding,
there are no laws for the first&nbsp;two.</p>
<p>As with <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/10/11/stem-cell-transplants-a-slide-show/">the first presentation I posted</a>, the slides are embeded below.

                <div class="summary"><p>As first-year fellows, we have to present a case at the Medical Oncology
Service tumor board every four weeks. Obviously, I can&#8217;t share the
details of those talks here. But I <em>can</em> post a sanitized version of my
slides, with all identifying information&nbsp;removed.</p>
<p>My first talk was about a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome who
underwent a stem cell transplant—the most straightforward case I could
think of from <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/09/06/what-i-learned-and-unlearned-on-bone-marrow-transplants/">my time on the transplant team</a>. Of course, there
is nothing straightforward about stem cell transplants—most internal
medicine residency programs don&#8217;t expose you to them at all. Which is why
I wanted to discuss the whole transplant&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>Most of the slides are not self-contained—I don&#8217;t like the wall-of-text school
of slide design—but may be a useful starting point. Most graphs and tables have
a references listed. The national statistics come from the <a href="http://www.cibmtr.org/ReferenceCenter/SlidesReports/SummarySlides/pages/index.aspx"><span class="caps">CIBMTR</span>
website</a>
and are available to everyone for&nbsp;download.</p>
<p>You can view a full screen version of my first talk ever

embeded&nbsp;below.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>I am not spiritual, or religious. Living in an atheist country that
suddenly takes a turn towards militant Christian fundamentalism does
that to you. I don&#8217;t believe in woo. I do believe that American doctors
are overtreating their patients&#8217; pain, and that American patients are
too sensitized to it. Yes, the understaffed orthopedic <span class="caps">VA</span> surgery wards
where post-op patients were screaming for their morphine may have led
to the Kabuki of a nurse coming in every couple of hours to ask you
about where your pain is, and what is the <span class="caps">QUALITY</span> of the pain, and
howbadisitfromonetoten? But a cancer center is no <span class="caps">VA</span>. The ritual only
reminds those with chronic cancer pain that yes, it is still there,
and yes, it hurts more than it did 3 hours ago, and now they can&#8217;t
finish reading their book because there is a twinge every couple of
minutes while they are thinking about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Which is all a longwinded way of saying that I should not have enjoyed the pain
and pallitavie rotation that much. There is spirituality, there is woo, there is
a lot of pain. And yet I&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>These people know what they are doing. They have plenty of resources
available to do it. And yes, they may &#8220;do Reiki&#8221;—nothing more
than elaborate Kabuki for patients with advanced diseases—but there are
times when that is exactly what the patients need. When 4am vital
signs and checking for hepatomegaly every day just aren&#8217;t&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Some useful questions to ask your patients with any serious chronic
disease, if and when you have some extra time in&nbsp;clinic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you the same person now as you were before the diagnosis? How did you&nbsp;change?</li>
<li>What do you fear the&nbsp;most?</li>
<li>What do you hope&nbsp;for?</li>
<li>Who(m) do you rely on for support?<sup id="fnref:whom"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:whom" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>The patients&#8217; answers may surprise&nbsp;you.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Did you hear the one about not prescribing angiotensin receptor blockers to
patients with <span class="caps">ACE</span> inhibitor-induced angioedema? I&#8217;ve had heated debates
with residents in my old clinic who did not want to even consider ARBs for
a patient with worsening diabetic nephropathy who&#8217;s had lip swelling
while on an <span class="caps">ACE</span>-I <em>ten years ago</em>.</p>
<p>Or the one about not giving these patients amlodipine, since there
are two—<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19299323">yes</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21330681">two</a>—case reports on amlodipine-associated
angioedema? Should we also stop giving them <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15120149">water</a>?</p>
<p>Then there are shellfish allergies and iodine contrast, fever and
atelectasis, morbid obesity and hypothyroidism… No matter how many
studies show these associations to be too weak to be clinicaly
significant, or just plain false, there will always be an attending
somewhere giving them as his or her pearl of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>We need some <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/335/7633/1288">medical mythbusting</a> for physicians, not just the lay&nbsp;public.</p>

why are you punishing me with this drivel? Just get us a good book</em>. So I did,
and the percieved length of my metro commute has decreased by two orders of
magnitude. Which is a convoluted way of saying that time flies when you&#8217;re
having fun<sup id="fnref:crap"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:crap" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But if you&#8217;ve never read a book in your life and are now devouring Buzzfeed like
a horsefly in a manure factory&#8212;-sorry, there is no help. It <em>is</em>&nbsp;you.</p>
