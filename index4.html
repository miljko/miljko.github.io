                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/12/20/why-be-a-chief-resident/">Why be a chief&nbsp;resident?</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>For the first time since joining Quora, I found <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-would-someone-choose-to-be-a-chief-resident-specifically-in-internal-medicine/">a question to which I can
meaningfuly contribute</a>. Thought you might like to see my&nbsp;answer.</p>
<h3>Why would someone choose to be a chief resident (in internal&nbsp;medicine)?</h3>
<p>Why&nbsp;indeed.</p>
<p>The cynical answers would be &#8220;out of a misguided sense of loyalty to
your program&#8221;. The correct and not very useful answer is—it&nbsp;depends.</p>
<p>Most positions entail primarily administrative responsibilities, with
some teaching and clinical duties, and a salary just slightly higher
than that of a <span class="caps">PGY</span>-3. So, you can expect your patient care skills to
languish unless you work on maintaining them, your teaching skills to
be slightly improved—or at least no worse if you&#8217;ve had some prior
experience—and your knowledge of hospital administration, people
management, dealing with email, and making the most out of seemingly
pointless meetings to go through the roof. If you have any interest in
academic medicine, as a generalist and sub-specialist alike, this last
skill set will be invaluable. It is also a stamp of approval of sorts
for any fellowship program director looking at your <span class="caps">CV</span> if and when you&nbsp;apply.</p>
<p>You also have much more free time. Depending on how many chiefs your
program has, it will be most or all weekends, and almost all federal
holidays. This is a good time to study for the boards if you haven&#8217;t
taken them already, write up the research you&#8217;ve been working on, or
spend some time with your family (the chief&#8217;s maternity/paternity leave
is usually more flexible, but that&#8217;s&nbsp;program-dependent).</p>
<p>The downsides: you will have one fewer year of attending-level salary,
so if you have a large debt or other financial responsibilities think
twice before saying yes; some friendships you made with the junior
residents will be undone or temporarily put on hold, unless you are
<em>very</em> careful about not playing favorites; you may lose some respect
for your higher-ups, as it goes whenever you peek behind the curtain;
you will need to develop a thick skin, if you don&#8217;t have one already.
Some would say these last two are actually pluses. It&nbsp;depends.</p>
<p>Visa issues complicate the matter, but I won&#8217;t go into
details—bureaucracy shouldn&#8217;t play a role in determining a career
choice, and when there is will (your own as well as the program&#8217;s) there
is a way to bypass any&nbsp;obstacles.</p>
<p>Hope this&nbsp;helps.</p>

                <h2><a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/12/17/a-few-good-pens/">A few good&nbsp;pens</a></h2>
                <div class="summary"><p>Helping out Georgetown University fellows with their oncology consult
service for a few days reminded me of how important it was to have at
least three good pens with you at all times. By that, I don&#8217;t mean
grabbing a handful of disposable Bics from a Staples shelf just because
you know you will lose a lot—though you should certainly plan for
theft and absent-mindedness. There are at least three different use
cases you will face daily, and no pen will be ideal for all of them.
I&#8217;ve tried out enough, <a href="http://www.relay.fm/penaddict">and listened to plenty of podcasts on the
topic</a>, to be happy with my&nbsp;choices.</p>
<h2>Role 1: The task&nbsp;keeper</h2>
<ul>
<li>My choice: <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-Push-Clip-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.4-mm-Black/pd/797">Zebra Sarasa Push Clip Gel Ink Pen, 0.4 mm&nbsp;black</a></li>
<li>First runner-up: <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Jetstream-Standard-Ballpoint-Pen-0.5-mm-Blue-Ink-White-Body/pd/3233">Uni Jetstream Standard Ballpoint Pen, 0.5 mm&nbsp;black</a></li>
<li>Honorable mention: <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Zebra-Sarasa-3-Color-Gel-Ink-Multi-Pen-0.5-mm-Black-Body/pd/2602">Zebra Sarasa 3 Color Gel Ink Multi Pen, 0.5&nbsp;mm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Intern or fellow, this will be your most-used pen—the one you pull out
to quickly jot and check off to-dos, make note of pertinent lab values
and vital signs, and write down other important bits of information. If
you are anything like me or my colleagues, you will be doing this on the
signout, or some other piece of paper packed with information you might&nbsp;need.</p>
<p>This is why your pen should&nbsp;be:</p>
<ul>
<li>as thin as possible, since you&#8217;ll likely write on the margins,&nbsp;but</li>
<li>not too faint, so it wouldn&#8217;t blend in with the rest of the&nbsp;text,</li>
<li>quick to use, since you&#8217;ll have to pull it out during rounds, patient
  encounters, and other situations in which fiddling with the cap would lead to
  losing both time and the cap,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>affordable, since you will misplace one every couple of&nbsp;months.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first two, the Uni Jetstream wins hands-down. The tip is as smooth
as a 0.5 mm can be. It doesn&#8217;t skip, spill, sploch, or splat. The price
is right—just $2.99 on jetpens.com. It is the best-in-class for every
thing save&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Zebra Sarasa Push Clip is not too thin, but thin enough to be scratchy
and slightly annoying. Even with that small flaw, I choose it before the
Jetstream. Because of the clip. The wonderful, magical&nbsp;clip.</p>
<p>You see, after four years of rounding, the act of pulling out a pen becomes
a reflex. You hear something important, you have a thought, you blink, and you
have a pen in one hand and your Very Important Paper in the other. You write
something down, you blink, and your hands are free again. You are one with the
sign out, and the&nbsp;pen.</p>
<p>To do that, you must at all times know where those two things are. The
Very Important Paper is hard to miss, but the pen needs to be not just
in the same pocket, but <em>in the same spot in your pocket</em> at all times.
For me, the whitecoat-less fellow, that&#8217;s the inside of my left front
pants pocket. This requirement rules out any clipless pens—goodbye, disposable
Bics—but the regular clips don&#8217;t fare too well either. Too tight a clip, and you
spend too much time fiddling it into the spot you want. Too loose, and it&#8217;s easy
to put in, and easy to&nbsp;lose.</p>
<p>Which is why the clip is magical. You open it wide on entrance, and clamp it
shut once you have the pen where you want it. It won&#8217;t budge after hours of
walking up and down the hospital stairs. And, unlike one of my Jetstreams, it
will be very difficult to&nbsp;break.</p>
<p>Alas, it only comes in one color. This is enough for the mild-to-moderate
inpatient workload of a fellow, but during internship I needed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JFR8Q8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002JFR8Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=intern0cd-20&amp;linkId=J323ILMTAPBLCF2E">the typical
gunner pen</a> to stay organized. Zebra Sarasa 3 is the high-end guner
pen—one color fewer, but with the Zebra clip. For me today, it is just too
bulky, I default to black anyway, and I&#8217;d just get annoyed with it running out
way before the other two. But for me four year ago, it would have been&nbsp;perfect.</p>
<h2>Role 2: The note&nbsp;writer</h2>
<p>My choice: <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Petit1-Mini-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib-Blue-Black/pd/8609">Ohto Graphic Liner Needle Point Drawing Pen - 02, 0.5 mm black</a>
Runner-up: <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Petit1-Mini-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib-Blue-Black/pd/8609">Pilot Petit1 Mini Fountain Pen - Fine Nib, any&nbsp;colour</a></p>
<p>As much as I appreciate the ammount of writing I can cram onto a sign
out with a thin pen, using one to write in paper charts, or for making
notes on an old H&amp;P while seeing a patient, creates an unreadable mess. The faint
black lines of your pen blend in with the small type and the gray ruled lines of
the progress note. Also, you don&#8217;t need as quick an access—a morning
note-writing session may seem hectic, but you are the one who initiates the
process. A couple of seconds looking for the pen or opening the cap won&#8217;t make
you lose any&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>The Ohto liner leaves a consistent, dark line, lasts for ages, and is the right
size for me. The ink is water-proof and archival safe—which is what you want for
a medico-legal document. There&#8217;s a cap you need to worry about, but I&#8217;ve yet to
lose one. And at $2.50 it won&#8217;t be the end of the world if I&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>This role can also be filled by a nice fountain pen—and you&#8217;ll see some
attendings using one. I have had horrible luck finding a fountain pen
that I won&#8217;t be afraid spilling in my bag or pocket, and most cost too
much to carry around the hospital while sleep-deprived. The Pilot Petit1
pens have the right price, nice nib, and are easy enough to use. But I&#8217;m
still too scared to put it in my&nbsp;pocket.</p>
<h2>Role 3: The&nbsp;backup</h2>
<p>My choice: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXWGWE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003FXWGWE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=intern0cd-20&amp;linkId=IOMW5AIFSOO3XGVF">Uni-ball Signo <span class="caps">DX</span> <span class="caps">UM</span>-151 Gel Ink&nbsp;Pen</a></p>
<p>This is the one you sprinkle around the house to be there just in case.
The one you give out to friends and colleagues. And the one you use if
you lose any of the others. If you needed to have just one pen, this
would be the one, since it&#8217;s both thin and dark. Not perfect for either
notes or task lists, but good&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>At slightly less than $2 per pen it is afordable enough, though if you
just want something to give out to others—and don&#8217;t care about them or
their fingers—you can get a box of 60 horrible little stick for the
price of three Signos. I guess you can give those out to your enemies
and watch them writhe in pain and&nbsp;frustration.</p>
<h2>Bonus: A pencil&nbsp;case</h2>
<p>My choice: <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Kokuyo-Will-Stationery-Actic-Mini-Pencil-Case-Black/pd/4352">Kokuyo Will Stationery Actic Mini Pencil&nbsp;Case</a></p>
<p>This is entirely optional, but it saved me a surprising amount of time. It
comfortably fits 4-5 pens and refills, and has good build quality. If your bag
is small or you don&#8217;t mind fishing around for the pen you want, you can
certainly do without&nbsp;it.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>A key skill to have during oral exams back in med school was never
to admit not knowing. Avoid the areas you&#8217;re uncertain of, dodge the
examiner&#8217;s field of expertise as much as you can, and never <em>ever</em>
say &#8220;I don&#8217;t&nbsp;know&#8221;.</p>
<p>These sage words were passed on from generation to generation,
propagated by everyone, including me. Only, this wasn&#8217;t what I or
any of my friends actually thought. It was a poke at the climate of
intellectual dishonesty at our school, not a guide to success in&nbsp;medicine.</p>
<p>Starting residency, though, flips the sarcasm switch somewhere and
the funny guidelines become instructions to be followed verbatim. The
knowledge in question is different—patient data instead of textbook
medicine—but the idea is the same. Observe the modern American intern&#8217;s&nbsp;vocabulary:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Not that I know of</em> (means <em>I don&#8217;t know</em>).</li>
<li><em>I wasn&#8217;t aware of that</em> (means <em>I didn&#8217;t know</em>).</li>
<li><em>I don&#8217;t think it is</em> (means <em>I don&#8217;t know if it is</em>).</li>
<li><em>I belive so</em> (means <em>I have no idea, but yeah, maybe</em>).</li>
<li><em>It probably was</em> (means <em>I don&#8217;t have a clue but I did a D6 roll in my head
  and it was a 5</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>I used all of the above, and more, during internship, but still
get frustrated hearing it from others<sup id="fnref:liar"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:liar" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you are an intern, or anyone
reporting patient data to a person above you in the pecking order, try using <em>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t know, but I can find out in a second&#8221;</em> instead. Then start practicing your
<span class="caps">EMR</span> skills to trully make it a&nbsp;second.</p>

                <div class="summary"><p>Six weeks of anyhing will get tiresome near the end, doubly so if it

neither did the high turnover<sup id="fnref:dictate"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dictate" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Still, as inpatient rotations
go, this one was reasonably busy—enough for me to learn quite a bit, but
never overwhelming. More importantly, the attendings <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2014/11/01/t-cellhistiocyte-rich-large-b-cell-lymphoma/">were awesome, the
cases interesting</a>, co-workers friendly,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>As the slide set I&#8217;ve linked to above shows, lymphoma are tricky in
that many are either curable or indolent enough to be kept at bay
until something else gets to the patient; but when it&#8217;s bad—and with
current technology we can&#8217;t with certainty say which ones those are at
diagnosis, <a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/20/20/5182.abstract?etoc">though we&#8217;re getting there</a>—it can be catastrophic.
Thankfully, those cases are&nbsp;rare.</p>
<p>Though most chemotherapy I was ordering was <a href="http://hemonc.org/wiki/Aggressive_Non-Hodgkin_lymphoma#DA-R-EPOCH"><span class="caps">EPOCH</span>-R</a> or, <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02203526?term=primary+cns+lymphoma&amp;rank=22">for
<span class="caps">NCI</span>&#8217;s new primary <span class="caps">CNS</span> lymphoma protocol</a>, <span class="caps">TEDDI</span>-R, there were
several patients with non-hematological malignancies getting <span class="caps">IL</span>-15. If
you hadn&#8217;t heard of this particular interleukin being used for treatment
before, it&#8217;s becuse the results of the first-in-humans phase I trial
done by <span class="caps">NCI</span> <a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2014/11/12/JCO.2014.57.3329.abstract">have just been published in <span class="caps">JCO</span></a>. The maximal
tolerated dose was somewhat low when administered as an intravenous
bolus, so the patients are now getting it either as a 12-day continuous
infusion, or a subcutaneous injection. I&#8217;d rather not steal Dr. Conlon&#8217;s
thunder—or break any government regulations—by writing how these patients did.
Just keep an eye for a follow-up paper. And maybe a tumor board presentation

<p>I first heard a version of this years ago, back in Serbia, while I was still
a med student. It hadn&#8217;t left much of an impression, but I can imagine myself
nodding my head and thinking <em>ha ha, yes, stupid Americans, ruining their own
language</em>, or something comparably&nbsp;obnoxious.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve, erm, matured since then. True, some euphemisms now inspire
rage instead of vague amusement, like my two&nbsp;favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I just wanted to let you know&#8221; instead of &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you&#8221;, and its
  relatives &#8220;Please let me know&#8221;, and &#8220;Thank you for letting me know&#8221;.
  Physicians are particularly fond of this, for we are the gatekeepers of
  knowledge, and the only reason you know something is because we are letting
  you. Don&#8217;t worry though, it&#8217;s not just you, we say that to each other all the&nbsp;time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I don&#8217;t feel comfortable doing xyz&#8221; instead of &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do
  xyz&#8221;, <a href="http://miljko.org/eng/2013/12/25/ten-common-residency-idioms-and-phrases">as mentioned here</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of them, though—particularly ones we use with patients—have a good
reason to exist. <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/translation/">The Radiolab segment which inspired this post</a>
made fun of &#8220;making someone comfortable&#8221; being used for dying <span class="caps">ICU</span> patients.
Instead of… what, exactly? Euthanasia? There is a difference between giving
someone drugs usualy meant for comfort—opioids, primarily—in order to kill them,
and giving them opioids for pain and comfort knowing it may shorten their&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Then there are turns of phrase used <em>because</em> they are euphemisms. &#8220;You
should get your affairs in order&#8221;, &#8220;your time is becoming limited&#8221;, &#8220;at
this point we should concentrate on quality of life, not quantity&#8221; are
all ways of saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when you&#8217;ll die, but it will be soon,
so start planning the funeral&#8221;. I am sure Mr. Carlin would appreciate
getting it straight, but not every patient is as stoic. We can easily
be more blunt if asked to do so, but you cannot un-hit a patient with a
sledgehammer like that. So the default is to err on the side of&nbsp;softness.</p>
<p>Then again, most of the euphemisms we use with patients also make <em>us</em>
more comfortable with the sitation. What I wrote above may then just be
my rationalizing it away with a convenient it&#8217;s-best-for-the-patient
mantra. In truth—to use another common phrase—euphemisitis is a
<em>multifactorial</em> condition (as in, I have no idea what the reasons are,
but it&#8217;s probably a little bit of&nbsp;everything).</p>
