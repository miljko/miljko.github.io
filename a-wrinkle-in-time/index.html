        <meta name="description" content="So much wasted potential in this one. It could have been a great movie for both children and adults, a Labyrinth for the age of CGI and social justice. Instead, it‚Äôs a confused, hurried mess in which lots of Stuff happens for no good reason; a Michael Bay extravaganza for your middle-schooler. My daughter (6) liked it, but even she questioned a major plot point. ‚ÄúBut, why did X become evil, daddy?‚Äù I‚Äôve no idea, Honey, and I‚Äôm not sure the screenwriters gave it much thought¬†either. Such is the faith of many book adaptations; this one even more so, having had to pass through the Disney committee wringer. I haven‚Äôt read the book(s? That‚Äôs how much I know about the potential franchise) but I‚Äôve read and watched enough fantasy to know that 1) your made-up world needs to have rules, and 2) if you break them, it better be for a good reason. The few week rules set in the Wrinkle‚Äôs first half are promptly broken at the half-time, with no explanation and nothing to replace them. Instead you get a holodeck of a planet, where anything can happen: hurricane in a haunted forest turns into a Stepford wives cul-de-sac turns into a crowded beach, and no there is nothing connecting those¬†dots. Which is too bad ‚Äî each one of those scenes would‚Äôve made a good episode for the second season of the unmade Wrinkle TV show, perfect for Disney‚Äôs new streaming service. Such a¬†waste. Directed by Ava DuVernay, 2018" />
