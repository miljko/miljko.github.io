		<p>If you have a Google+ account—and you might not be aware that you do—anyone using Gmail <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/reach-people-you-know-more-easily.html">can now email you</a> without knowing your address. You can disable this "feature" in the settings, but having it be opt-out shows yet again how little Google cares about privacy.</p>
<p>Not that there's anything wrong with that—privacy is a relatively modern invention that younger generations might not care for as much as we do. But you should understand the implications of patients and random strangers being able to leave messages in your personal inbox. Suing P.,,,,,,kmmmmmqmmmdoctors is <a href="http://www.innovateus.net/content/medicine-code-hammurabi"><em>not</em> a modern invention</a>.</p>
<p>This is why I stopped using all Google services—search included—years ago. The company has become so large, with so many users, that it doesn't need to cater to fringe interests. And for a business with billions of users, doctors are a fringe group—one that hates <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution">change-for-change's-sake</a>, having to [re-learn an interface][ n. Nnjm   interface] "just because", and not being <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-newman/youre-not-googles-custome_b_841599.html">the true customer</a><sup id="fnref:emr"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:emr" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Also, the number of people at Google who may access my data is huge. <a href="http://www.ownmail.net/?STKI=10207929">FastMail</a><sup id="fnref:referral"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:referral" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, my email provider of choice, has fewer than 10 employees. Gmail alone has hundreds. Not that anyone would be interested in me in particular, but if I ever inadvertently send or receive private patient information through my personal account, I'd rather as few people as possible see it.</p>
<p>Email is fine, but why abandon search? First, I have googled enough ailments and substances, common and obscure, that the add network thought I was an elderly female recovering heroin addict with more than one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia">paraphilia</a>. The adds I would get were in that sense appropriate. Second, because of SEO the only valuable page-one results I would get were Wikipedia entries. Everything else was a hodgepodge of useless Livestrong, Huffington post and five-pages-per-500-word-article-AND-behind-a-login-wall Medscape links. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">Duckduckgo</a> and, yes, <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a> at least help with the first problem while not making the second one any worse.</p>
<p>Google calendar is the only service I would consider using. It is fast, reliable, omnipresent and easy to use. There is, however, that constant nagging fear that they will find <em>some</em> way to integrate it with Google+ and yet again sacrifice functionality to force people into its circle<sup id="fnref:heh"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:heh" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. This is why I use Apple's iCloud calendar, its horrendous web interface and all.</p>
<p>Also: Reader. I use <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/">FeedWrangler</a> now, but <em>man</em>.</p>
<p>Doctors' concerns aside, Google is all set to become the network TV<sup id="fnref:ms"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:ms" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> of the internet—large, bland, and largely not relevant to the people who are. It is already two-thirds of the way there.</p>

<p>This one in particular, as it keeps reminding me that doctors are second-class citizens in the tech world. Electronic health records are made with the billing departments in mind—we are there to provide content.
